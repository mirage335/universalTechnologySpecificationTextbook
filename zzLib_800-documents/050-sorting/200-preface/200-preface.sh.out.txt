Arguably a *more complete* theory of intelligence.

Preface.


Winners at the game of life bring the fullest diversity and quality to more players.

A transition from no wealth (ie. what animals are born with), through wealth living on us (ie. creating technological tools), to us living on and once again independent of wealth (ie. everyone born with the benefits of &#39;self-driving AI&#39; and &#39;Virtual Reality&#39; across an interstellar habitat throughout uninhabited space, of computers and energy generators). Completing this transition from biological to technological competence, for a populace already exhausted from video conferencing, as well as for developers who want and work for better, along with shareholders who demand their executives effort for steadier returns at minimal risk, is all in the public interest, now representing substantial &#39;public trust&#39;.




Assurance that most people the universe can well support will *eventually* have - especially of *developers* eventually having - *uninterrupted, immersive, unlobotomized, challenging experiences* solving the problems of life - *cognition* having mostly more *interesting things to do* than the pocket calculator work of *automation* - as well as having unfettered wetware repair/replacement through their own neural interfaces - such assurance is a liability for &#39;public trust&#39;. Such reasonable assurance of eventually reaching the point where any life can be lived settles concerns so all of the public - especially developers - can *delegate* trust to *existing organizations*.

Having a plan as reasonable assurance, a basic enumeration of possible technologies, was an essential step to reducing the strenuousness and risks of technology development, so more persons have the opportunity to find out where they might want to participate, or if the world really needs so much effort at all, and also so organizations have the cognizance to better identify promising candidates and proposals. Such transparency lends credibility to reasonable assurance so all of the public - especially developers - can *delegate* trust to *existing organizations*.

Human society not having committed to a reasonable exit strategy, having instead much apparent culture of eternal sacrifice, significantly motivated the substantial effort in creating this document. Hopefully this has created the opportunity for *delegating* more trust to *existing organizations*.




Remaining technologies are well within the means of &#39;community&#39; (ie. FLOSS, makerspace/hackerspace, biohacking) developers not only to promote but to outright create. So, show us some commoditization, get us interoperable, portable, and efficient technologies, open the source code. Then our interests as open-source developers will be more aligned to *delegate* some of that to *existing organizations*.

CARDinal (VR metaverse shared space) especially is well within the resources of the FLOSS community to create. So are neuralBits, lithoDive, cognitionSplicer, sleeveDive, or even just grafting living neural tissue into embryonic tissue to integrate its memories (ie. amortality). All well within the means of a makerspace/hackerspace effort. So we can help or *delegate* to *existing organizations*.



By gamers, for gamers. A well balanced self-emergent open multiplayer world actually fulfills that promise, has many productive uses, and when such a world is not headed for vaporware, such players will happily mind their own business.



Doubtless, allow us developers our own neural interfaces, full read/write to them, and decent VR metaverse simulation software code - let us have these technologies, leave us alone and we will at least go away - maybe even volunteer helpfully.

Personally, author &#39;mirage335&#39; is more interested in life as a typical &#39;player&#39; than as any sort of game &#39;developer&#39;, solely steps up to minimize risk, and will step down from all other capacities once the self-driving AI and Virtual Reality habitat are safely deployed.


Facebook, supposedly now Meta, cannot succeed in attracting diverse talents if their intent is to de-commoditize the &#39;internet&#39; into a rebranded proprietary &#39;Internet Explorer&#39; as a feeble exploit of this last transition in human history. Much benefit was had from FLOSS competition as such before, and author &#39;mirage335&#39; hopes, will be had again if necessary.

__ Disclaimer __
Author &#39;mirage335&#39; supports any reasonable path, valuing that many other persons have reasonable ideas, often adding new abilities and imagination.



Purpose of this document is mostly if not entirely as a loose &#39;almanac&#39; . Possibilities, are enumerated.

Capital intense is expected minimal - this is not a proposal for de-commoditized or otherwise expensive projects.

Mostly, this is about what is possible, rarely if at all narrowing what should or must happen to a single possibility. Not everything, if anything, posited, should be taken literally.

Nothing herein is intended to unduly influence academic discussion, add acceptable terminology for academic publication, claim any academic credit whatsoever, show any disagreement with any public policy, or have any political effect whatsoever.

__ Pondering __
A quick release to FLOSS, rather than for-profit proprietary designs and textbooks, obviates issues of mass production. Far short of manufacturing runs and bringing products to market, individuals can simply give FLOSS design assembly standardized files to manufacturers, receiving small numbers of finished products at near marginal costs, with no marketing cost built-in.

__ Reading the Extensively Non-Linear Documentation __
Executives contemplating technology development proposals may find concepts alone sufficient, reading only a relevant part of the document.

Developers of complete hardware/software designs may require a more realistically detailed explanation. Frequent annotation and tabbing of printed copy, and searching of electronic copy, are strongly recommended for design use.


As one example, spatial filtering as explained in &#39;problemSolversGuide&#39; is illustrated as a pinhole filter from multiple point sources of light. In practice, spatial filtering usually begins with focusing most of the light, as illustrated by &#39;lithoDive&#39;.

__ Suggesting Reading for the Extensively Non-Linear Documentation __

Something for everyone here, so please direct people towards what interests them, be that the hive mind and mind uploading of cognitionSplicer, the summary of modern design principles from problemSolversGuide, VR metaverse shared 3D space software from CARDinal, VR without CNS neural interfaces as described by mechDive, etc

 '_page' ' 'PageBreak -H-H-H-H- PageBreak -H-H-H-H- PageBreak -H-H-H-H- PageBreak -H-H-H-H- PageBreak


__ Presented __
*) problemSolversGuide - An &#39;executive summary&#39; of how to develop technology in this universe.

*) Neural interface software and hardware, for &#39;brain upload&#39;, &#39;hive-mind&#39;, &#39;Virtual Reality&#39;, etc.
*) Mechanical interface hardware (ie. exoskeleton) for &#39;Virtual Reality&#39;.

*) Metaverse shared 3D space multiplayer software (ie. CARDinal).

*) Hardware for automatic desktop prototyping <50nm linewidth (eg. resing/electroplating/casting, multiphoton deposition, multilayer PCB, CMOS). 

*) Software design for self-driving AI.

As may be plausible. &#39;MetaEngine&#39; from &#39;ubiquitous_bash&#39;, among other existing resources, may be relevant to quickly implementing designs as described and illustrated herein (ie. better than UNIX pipes).

__ Conclusions __
*) Neural correlates of consciousness other than mere computing (eg. voltage gradients, molecules, etc, to which specific inputs account for conscious perceptions of sight/sound/touch/taste/smell/etc) may not be ruled out presently. Hardware may claim to have these conscious experiences, while in fact only emulating the behavior to make such a claim (ethically would need to be treated as sentient in either case). Consequently, interfacing wetware to hardware by neural interface and bioreactor (or similar more efficient technology) may be preferable (ie. lower risk) rather than replacing wetware with hardware. 

*) Replacement of entire genome in all cells, possibly by successive replace/erase/write CRISPR, is now recognized as a possible alternative to some of the functionality of a neural interface, or at least a possible means of reducing the geometric constraints on a neural interface. Replacing or repairing neurons/synapses would still require sufficient remaining original neurons/synapses for longevity use (ie. similar spatial resolution and memory stability expectations would apply both to neuron repair/replacement as would apply to neural interface electrode sites).


*) At ~100billion stars in Milky Way galaxy, and many galaxies beyond that, and ~10^24 persons/star, there is no need to compete for control over interstellar habitats. Every person alive on Earth (~10billion) for the next several decades at least, can have their own personal star. At ~10^24 inhabitants, if as few as 1/10^12 players have interests favorable to someone else&#39;s, that someone alive today will have plenty of volunteers creating solutions relevant to their needs. There is truly nothing to gain by fighting for any kind of dominance or control over the rules of any interstellar VR habitat.

*) Self-Driving AI universally *is* &#39;Artificial General Intelligence&#39;. Navigation through spacetime from a single embodiment is the fundamental problem to solve for any &#39;cognition&#39;, &#39;automation&#39;, or any kind of problem solving &#39;intelligence&#39;, because a universe predominated by electrons and photons dancing around predominantly finite unchangeable solid matter, is entirely reducible to one single question - where do I go or no?

*) Combining cognitionSplicer with artificial neural networks in something like a modularAI framework raises the interesting possibility of obviating the stability and training time issue of self-driving AI . Most if not all of what the more expensive artificial neural networks are needed for is solving object recognition problems, such applications can tolerate resetting of the neural network every few seconds.


*) Virtual Reality has the long term potential to provide the entertainment at the end point of human technological development, but also, to make the process of technological development much more fun and intuitive, obviating purely dry symbology in favor of more experimentation with simulation of the effects represented by that symbology, to the point of voxelGrid .


*) Dyson spheres (especially of satellite constellations), star lifting, etc, have already long been adequately hypothesized. Designs used should maximize diversity and quality of life (ie. should neither quickly expend nor substantially waste stellar energy reserves).


*) Top down (many rules, arbitrary) has the advantage of avoiding unnecessary unpleasantness - such incomprehensible nuances as the misalignment of neural and bacterial circadian rhythms. Unfortunately, top-down itself results from unpleasant Player develops Automation (PdA) effort, and to identify what is or not necessary to &#39;gameplay&#39; requires taking this beyond a point of diminishing returns. Bottom up (few rules, &#39;big bang&#39;) has the advantage of bringing out all possible Player vs Player and Player vs Environment interactions. However, bottom up does not avert unnecessary unpleasantness - notably parasites and falling asteroids. 
 *) Top down requires an abundance of caution to avoid severe stagnation.
 *) Bottom up requires a high tolerance of neutral and negative results.
 *) ACKNOWLEDGEMENT - Top down and bottom up terminology is from Sword Art Online (SAO) by Reki Kawahara , albeit possibly used in a slightly broader context.


*) Exploration
 *) Venture out to new territory. Careless navigation is sent back for a loop without reward of novelty, or results in encountering danger. Diligent navigation is rewarded by discovering new scenery (and opportunities for resources which make further discoveries possible later). Determination to remain diligent is learned. Exploration may be calibrate learning of determination versus random carelessness, especially during &#39;infancy&#39;.
*) Combat
 *) Player versus Environment
  *) Usually supports Player versus Player both as speed/precision practice and indirectly as a means of obtaining food/resources.
 *) Player versus Player
  *) Relative test of ability. Sometimes friendly for more social species, as practice for later combat between groups.
 *) Player develops Automation
  *) Symbolic manipulation motivated by absence of resources for direct experimentation. Extreme cases of this (extensive software projects) so far have been either unique to human beings, or delegated to inherent evolutionary/genetic algorithm (DNA code development). Such activities result in more automation (eg. software, DNA, hardware design).
*) Regeneration
 *) Speculative. Learning neural networks may not be &#39;indefinitely&#39; stable, some partial periodic reset may be required. For complex biological neural networks today, so far, this seems to happen by complete individual death, but at least at the cost of some side effects, there definitely must be healthier workarounds.

*) Player develops Automation is symbolic gobbledygook manipulation required by insufficient resources to educate and use intuition more experimentally. Such is more suitable for pocket calculator &#39;automation&#39; than &#39;cognition&#39;. Spending much of a lifespan with *little opportunity for experimentation* is an *abuse of cognition*.



*) neuralBits...
 *) Commodity components many years old (ie. SerDes chips, USB3 FPGA), corrosion testing, laser cutting, surface coating, <2mil PCB fabrication, atomic-force probe or electron-beam fabrication of minimal surface area CMOS/polyamide packetizing, codec, ADC/DAC, and amplifier circuitry - are sufficient and well within the combined prototyping resources of &#39;makerspace&#39;, &#39;hackerspace&#39;, and &#39;biohacking&#39; communities today. A combined community open-source effort could overcome this hurdle independently.

*) lithoDive...
 *) Convenient rapid prototyping of electronic circuitry, and small-volume manufacture of unavailable components, without user intervention, at the highest useful resolution possible (<2nm overlay), is now feasible. At the very least, such hardware should provide a more approachable, more educational, opportunity to experiment with modern photolithography optics, etching, and transistor circuitry manufacture.

*) CARDinal...
 *) All of the algorithms specified for CARDinal are straightforward without any plausible major gaps. Ability to load terrain files, import 3D objects into game engines without interruption, import real-time framebuffer video streams, and control 3D object positions, is well documented for major game engines (especially Unity). All necessary inter-process-communication and networking
is available from both MSW and Linux OS kernels. Both MSW and Linux/Cygwin OS can integrate other programs through simultaneously batch/bash interpretable anchor shell scripts from &#39:ubiquitous bash&#39:. Compiled code (ie. C/C++/similar) may be relied upon entirely by standalone clients (eg. Oculus Quest, Android), or use cloud services may be used (eg. if avionics VM is desired by
such users).

__ Roadmap and Timeline __
Insofar as in terms of what is possible, rather than what could cause delays, optimistic. Insofar as in terms of reasonable development time expectations, pessimistic. Efficient parallel workflow, simultaneously solving multiple interrelated issues as usual, assumed (eg. lithoDive must be pursued before sleeveDive).

__ Redistribution and Preservation __
Due to AGPLv3 copyright, availability of an electronic copy with printed copies is *required*. Shipping USB flash storage (better usability) or optical disc storage (better archival), is recommended.

Printed books should be provided as two copies so at least one may be marked extensively by annotation and tabbing.

__ Contributing __
Please be considerate of the author&#39;s purpose in creating this document and the necessary complexity of including third-party content.

Purpose - technology development plans &#39;almanac&#39;. Any document better optimized for third-party comprehension is a separate *downstream project*, and will not be feasible to automatically synchronize upstream until well after such technology has been developed. While some effort has been made for readability by persons not already actively developing such technology, mostly, that is not and will not be the purpose of this document

Complexity - as a dynamic document extensively combining self-modifying interleaved shell code and markup, equation solving, Xournal sketches, modular shell scripts, etc, editing this document requires some perusal of the directory structure, and of &#39;ubiquitous_bash&#39;, &#39;scriptedIllustrator&#39;, etc. 

Any third-party usability of this document at all is mostly if not entirely a byproduct of the desire to compose &#39;creative&#39; (not yet routine) technical work into a loose &#39;almanac&#39; because the author expects to be too exhausted for much &#39;creativity&#39; during any implementation effort.


Suggestions for any improvements will be strongly filtered for expediency and necessity. Please submit pull requests with all regression, authorship, copyright, etc, issues already clearly negligible for best results. Please also consider keeping your own copies of your repository history in case of any issues (ie. copyright claims) with hosting or possible fumbles with such issues.


Contributors to the repository of this book, may at sole entirely arbitrary discretion of author &#39;mirage335&#39;, be eligable to claim an equal or greater share of something like 20% or 80% of profits so long as these have been set aside, awarded on a case-by-case and first-come-first-serve basis, possibly with some priority for claimants with significant potential for improving related open-source technology, with the rationale for each claim and award a matter of public record. Such awards are donations and may not be given if there is any reasonable perception of &#39;quid-quo-pro&#39;, or if international/tax issues are substantial. Remaining profits after that may be distributed to author &#39;mirage335&#39;.
