Roadmap Errata

GNU Electric -> Transistor, ADC, Multiplexing, Bus Modems, etc -> Specialized Geometry Stamps
Specialized Geometry Stamps -> lithoDive -> Analog Electronics Testing -> Corrections -> GNU Electric


Specialized Geometry Stamps -> CARDinal -> Scripting of copying component geometry to Trestles, Bundles, Threads -> Object Postions -> Complete Photomask Layers to Scan
Complete Photomask Layers to Scan -> lithoDive manufacturing -> Corrections -> CARDinal
Complete Photomask Layers to Scan -> lithoDive manufacturing -> complete neuralBits


FPGA to FPGA testing of neuralBits protocol with VR neural decoder to CARDinal IPC
	At least one FPGA is connected to a standalone program or computer emulating a 'dummy' of ES connected to an oversimplified model of expected analog read/write 


CARDinal Scripting -> Artificial Neural Network -> cognitionSplicer experimental software
cognitionSplicer experimental software -> FPGA to FPGA emulated neuralBits recording and readout of connectome and synaptic weights



complete neuralBits & cognitionSplicer experimental software & neuralBits protocol with VR neural decoder to CARDinal IPC -> Personal Experimentation

*) Recording sites for 'brain uploading' ordered by expected priority at 0.1mm/1% (neural processing cell/axon) or >100%
(nerve/vertebrae transmission) - inferior temporal gyrus, corpus callosum, entire temporal lobe, somatosensory cortex, prefrontal
cortex, hippocampus, entire neocortex, entire amygdala, vertebrae, glossopharyngeal nerve, vestibulocochlear nerve (inertial
cues), olfactory nerve, terminal nerve (uncertain), trigeminal nerve (possibly magnetic cues), remaining cranial/peripheral
nerves, all nerve endings (eg. by 'neural dust' in sensory tissue implanted under guidance towards locations causing CNS evoked
potentials), all remaining neural tissue."
