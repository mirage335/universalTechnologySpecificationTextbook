_ memoryRegeneration _
Learning long-term neural network stabilization, if necessary, by *isolation* (exocortex), by *refresh* (spatial/temporal object neural decoder), and/or by *partial reset* (increased forgetting rate while doing important things).

Highly speculative. Memory capacity of a neural network must be finite (unless some unexpected &#39;handwavium&#39; new physics). Yet neural network memory apparently is somewhat of a &#39;soft&#39; limit, seemingly endless until &#39;memory interference&#39; and/or absence of novelty seemingly causes either poor reaction times or demotivation &#39;sensory deprivation&#39;.

Absence of novel information may actually cause a neural network to degrade faster than a steady rate of novel information to learn. From a hypothetical neurological or mathematical perspective, all learning neural networks may be long-term stability limited due to useful memory object cross-association with noise at least every time the memory is recalled - less detailed sub-objects being more noisy to begin with. From a hypothetical psychological perspective, vividly motivating experiences become much less memorable after the first experience. A &#39;Player develops Automation&#39; (PdA) emphasizing lifestyle drastically worsens such degradation, the symbolic manipulation beginning with less novel &#39;signal&#39; and accumulating more chaotic &#39;noise&#39;. Both these (regeneration) problems are solved biologically along with any physical degradation by abrupt complete replacement of all wetware and loss of all associated memory - *death*. Much &#39;science fiction&#39; has already widely recognized this as such possible issues as the &#39;fever dream&#39; of novelty, having &#39;seen it all&#39; (or imagined), severe boredom from immortality, etc.

Mortality is a rather expensive solution for either artificial neural networks (ie. self-driving AI) or biological neural networks (ie. people preferring to better or longer enjoy the problem solving game of life). Gamers are well acquainted with &#39;amortality&#39; as &#39;respawning&#39; already as a means of experiencing problem solving taken to the point of victory or defeat. Adding memory storage/retrieval as an &#39;amortality&#39; &#39;respawning&#39; feature extends such workarounds to the lifelong processes of learning and forgetting.

__ Introduction __
Cognition memory retrieval requires comparably expensive computation. All possible solutions to neural network memory capacity limits are either both computationally and storage intensive, or erase memories.

Neural networks may be regarded as similar to amplifier feedback loops - sensory input, internal modeling, motor output, back to sensory input - with the memories which modify internal modeling (ie. learned neural network processing) as a complex adaptive set of band-pass filters. If such (vaguely) band pass filters accumulate without removal, and/or if the means to add new band pass filters are irreversibly reduced by loss of neurons and synaptic pruning, a neural network may be reduced to a noise amplifier, incapable of problem solving (aka. &#39;intelligent behavior&#39;).


Partial reset of memories is by far the most straightforward, and expected to allow sufficient retention of actually useful memories, especially once humans accumulate sufficient wealth to &#39;retire&#39; in favor of &#39;self-driving AI&#39;.



*) Isolation of memories may keep neural networks learning to the limits of available information storage and computing. Iterative copy of RPT correlations from a learning neural network to a long-term storage neural network subsequently &#39;frozen&#39; as a non-learning neural network and &#39;firewalled&#39; by bandwidth and threshold limits to prevent rapid cross-association of noisy/irrelevant old memories back into the learning neural network. Essentially &#39;puts old memories on the proverbial shelf&#39; - downsides being increasing storage/retrieval costs possibly as high as equal to the entire cognition per snapshot, including some repetitive conscious awareness of boring old memories.
 *) Exocortex to shelve memories to must be capable of both learning and &#39;freezing&#39; learning - rather capable hardware (whole brain emulation) is required, and any consciousness of such an exocortex may be significantly undesirable.

*) Refresh of memories, may keep neural networks learning to the limit of the noise rejection ratio of a neural decoder. From TX events and/or RPT correlations (ie. &#39;cognitionSplicer&#39;), a rather &#39;analog&#39; neural decoder may be able to extract spatial/temporal information, then either purifying of noise and abberation, replacing with a much simpler object new experiences will find novel replacements for, or replacing with a less noisy object acquired from earlier recordings. Replacements are then iteratively rewritten.  Only less noisy objects from earlier recordings will definitely have large, definitive TX event patterns, recognizable across large regions of neocortex ES at reasonably expected densities. Persons not having such recordings continuously from early life to the present may not be able to rely on memory refresh alone without great permanent disability.
 *) Neural decoder with useful noise rejection ratio or reasonable computational efficiency may be impossible.
 *) Memory object storage/retrieval may be efficient but saving every memory may still be an unjustified waste of space.

*) Partial reset of memories. Iterative reset closer toward a default connectome and synaptic weights (ie. simple gradients) while actively using the memories desired to keep. In the most extreme case, a few highly desirable memories (eg. sense of continuity having been alive previous day, things that will not likely be relearned in another lifetime, etc) are reconstructed as a &#39;single-player game&#39; (or possibly multiplayer with specific features for each of a very limited number of participants), which a person plays through while all other memories are gradually blanked.



Iterative copy/rewrite/reset for isolation, refresh, and/or partial reset, uses repeated measurement of RPT correlations, calculation of desired connectome and synaptic weights, and stimulation in the patterns that would be expected of the desired presence/absence of RPT correlations, until desired presence/absence of RPT correlations has been achieved. Such exploits the &#39;neurons fire together wire together&#39; and &#39;out of sync lose their link&#39; learning.

Complete copying of a connectome and synaptic weights (ie. a backup) is of course possible and may be combined with memory isolation, refresh, partial reset. Risk being that &#39;spinning up&#39; older memories may regress now satiated desires to unsatiated (incurring a desire to repeat the memory isolation, refresh, and partial reset as well as any experiences since all over again), which may be a significant expense against moving on to actually new experiences.

__ Conclusions __
If less sharp memories are formed in a neural network that is not at neutral defaults, possibly due to retreading of already existing but worsening signal-to-noise ratio pathways, then such degradation cannot be reversed by interactively reliving similar experiences, making the degradation permanent without some isolation/refresh/reset. A lifestyle of symbolic problem solving (ie. &#39;Player develops Automation&#39;, instead of experimentation), will cause such degradation substantially faster.

Looking at this issue from a more hypothetical psychological, rather than hypothetical neurological, perspective, presenting a player with a vividly highly motivating experience in VR, or early childhood, may result in immediate, non-reconstructive, essentially photographic memory. Such a &#39;fever dream&#39; (as mentioned in the beginning pages of &#39;Sword Art Online&#39;) of immediate photographic memory does not happen for similar experiences twice in a lifetime, leading to the &#39;seen it all&#39; (or imagined) trope. &#39;Altered Carbon&#39; imagines similar problems at the opposite end of life, with at least some of the more long-lived characters seemingly bored into ruthless depravity.

Phonological loop amplification, particularly emphasized by absence of preoccupation with PvP/PvE, task tracking, and delayed gratification, all inherent to substantial &#39;Player develops Automation&#39;, may substantially worsen cross-association of irrelevant memories with any (possibly also irrelevant) memories in the buffer.

 
Irreversible synaptic pruning, or neuron loss, represents permanent physical degradation &#39;brain damage&#39;, which may inevitably accumulate in older wetware, irreversible by isolation/refresh/reset . Replacement wetware may be required (ie. &#39;sleeveDive&#39; ).





Sleep may be a limited memory refresh process, possibly ineffective due to poor noise rejection ratio, and a biological neural network that may be disordered by chaotic noise and possibly ordered only by overwhelming novelty forming strong synapses. Such would be consistent with insomnia as a consequence of insufficient novelty. Recording detailed brain activity (ie. RPT correlations) to determine synaptic weight strength for clinical insomnia cases, while returning to a heavy preoccupation with a healthy PvP/PvE lifestyle, may be neuroscientifically interesting.


Memory interference and memory signal-to-noise ratios could be *measurable objective metrics of mental health* (not just for human wetware but also AI statistical classification neural networks).









Disrupting current brain activity might be useful as a user activated retroactive recent memory removal or blocking tool, taking memorable objects out of the phonological loop before much undesired cross-association occurs.

Partial memory loss is enforceable by CARDinal as a multiplayer game beginning condition from statistical evaluation of movement patterns that would show both whether a player was relearning most basic skills and whether a player was subject to degradation otherwise expected. This may be important to other players (as with any similar &#39;anti-cheat&#39;) who wish to begin a game of life with maximum potential for motivation (ie. &#39;sharp memories&#39; and &#39;fever dream&#39;).

	&#39;Common in Greek Mythology and in Asian mythology. In fact, one of the main rivers of the underworld was the Lethe, whose water would explicitly cause amnesia. Drinking fresh blood (animal would do) would break the spell at least temporarily, as seen when Odysseus visited the underworld looking for advice from the by-then dead seer Teiresias in the Odyssey.&#39;
