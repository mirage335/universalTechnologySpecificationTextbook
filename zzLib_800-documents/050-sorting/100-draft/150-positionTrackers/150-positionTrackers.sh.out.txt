_ positionTrackers _
Combined camera, &#39;lighthouse&#39;, ultrasonic, interferometric, speckle (highly precise structured light), magnetic, and/or ultrasonic, position tracking, for best possible accuracy and precision, at lowest cost.

Low-cost surface-mount commodities (ie. microcontroller, LEDs, laser diodes, MEMS inertial chips, inductors, frequency mixers, envelope detector schottky/germanium diodes) are sufficient to track objects with best possible accuracy and precision beyond-line-of-sight for all plausible uses (eg. &#39;VR roomscale&#39;, &#39;VR HOTAS emulated controllers&#39;, mechDive exoskeleton, mechDive tunneling, CNC low-latency position feedback correction).

__ Introduction __
Single (possibly flexible) PCB can integrate all the negligible cost widely available hardware for each plausible use case. Microcontrollers of the lowest cost and highest availability have sufficient analog and digital hardware.

Object emitter. Sub-mm for &#39;VR roomscale&#39, mechDive exoskeleton, tool/workpiece
*) LED CDMA emitters. Frequently (>>10Hz) calibrate accurate position to camera line-of-sight. Communicate button presses beyond-line-of-sight.
*) Magnetic inductor differential *emitter* (magnetic field RF antennas), analog frequency filters, diode detectors, frequency (or phase comparing) mixers, amplifiers. Frequently (>>10Hz) calibrate accurate position beyond-line-of-sight after occasional (<3600second) LED/camera calibration line-of-sight.
*) MEMS accelerometers. High frequency (>>100Hz) precise position/rotation increments from low-frequency tracking.


Overlay and VirtualStick tracker. High-precision (<250um) short distance (<0.5m) for hand/finger tracking (ie. precision paw tracking, &#39;VR HOTAS emulated controllers&#39;), tool/workpiece. Less common than object emitter alone due to strict line-of-sight requirement.
*) Camera, low-resolution high-framerate (ie. HID mouse optical tracking camera). Precisely observes movement of structured light from laser speckle.
*) Object emitter. Less precise, occasional (<180second) accuracy recalibration, communication of button presses and such.

Short distance limitation of speckle sense is due to eye damage risk of >>30mW point sources of light. Where this is not a concern (ie. sealed CNC machinery), tracking distance may be much longer (~5m, or >>5m with focusing optics).

Ultrasonic tracking is only useful for mechDive tunneling, using inexpensive piezoelectric materials and inexpensive hydrophones (which may be fiber optic). Such rare usage would nevertheless justify any plausible expense or inconvenience.

Interferometric tracking of linear distance - by resonant optical cavity or (more speculatively) synthetic aperture observations of a point source - feasible at low cost - is expected either unnecessary (due to through-lens overlay) or limited to the very specialized mechanism to track the edges of workpiece slabs .

*) Sketches of plausible use cases and component layouts.
*) Angular resolution calculations.
As may be plausible.

__ Conclusions __
Magnetic tracking is usually superior to ultrasonic tracking, though less compact. Magnetic tracking is most useful for beyond-line-of-sight tracking after occasional (a few times per hour) calibration. Ultrasonic tracking may lose accuracy immediately after any calibration due to refractions and reflections, so is most useful where compactness, precision, and beyond-line-of-sight are imperative (ie. mechDive tunneling).

Oculus constellation has rare low-cost ~1000FPS cameras. Alternative is USB3 FPGA3 adapters to adequate camera sensor chips.

Due to dependency on high-frequency capture of small amplitude changes at any reasonable rate of motion, amplitude modulated identification of individual speckle sense transmitters is probably not feasible.

__ Estimate - Angular Diameter and Resolution - VR HOTAS positioning. __
Notably, if the ratios of observation diameter/distance and aperture wavelength/diameter are equal, then the observation angular diameter and aperture angular resolution will also be equal.

Observation diameters larger than ~50um (much larger than wavelength) may use non-coherent LED ultraviolet light sources (ie. 365nm).
