_ Rough _

*) Prototype should be built from discrete components. After all, 'duplicate this in VLSI' is a relatively straightforward proposal, and this allows the amplifier performance to be validated in advance.
 *) 0202 Components are already ~<550um*~<350um ...
 *) Resolution of 6mil is 150um ...
 *) REMINDER - Re in differential tail circuit must be much higher than Rc, and ideally a pure current source, to prevent common mode voltages changing collector voltage.

*) User-selectable limits open-source firewall periodically certified software and hardware. In the most basic mode, VR only with low-resolution high-threshold motor outputs.

*) Dedicated microfluidics and fiber-optics may be added alongside, or as part of, any of these probes. Very slightly pressurizedMicrofluidic channels in particular, may improve electrode impedance, fill in collateral damage around rigid threads, or improve flexible mesh threads.


*) MAJOR - Hydrogels (ie. contact lens material) are highly plausible.






--------------------------------------------------
REVIEW - May be duplicative from (another) part of (another) document.


*) Regardless of whether the interface is display panel, mechanical vibration, electrotactile, or direct neural interface, video compression is applicable. VR software requires modules able to export real-time compressed greyscale video represent visual as well as tactile interactions (ie. collision virtual objects convertible to pressure, vibration, temperature, stretch). 

*) Although somewhat invasive, spinning wires (eg. of tungsten carbide) with suitable tips may be used as drill bit microneedles penetrating most of skull. A large array of these (ie. ~1mm spatial resolution) could be competitive with more completely invasive interfaces for VR purposes. Especially if reaching intra-dural.
 *) Diamond abrasive tips may avoid any requirement for drill bit shaping, minimizing cost.
 *) Collateral damage to pass-through tissue (ie. scalp) would be a non-issue if diameter was a relatively small fraction of minimal spatial resolution (ie. ~0.1mm/~1mm).
 *) MAJOR - Motorization of wires is potentially a minor expense. A single motor may spin and push multiple wires simultaneously (using some kind of gearing arrangement), resulting in 'microneedle array' like behavior.
  *) Very high resolution 3D printing would may benefit this considerably.
  *) Belts may spin microneedles by friction. Pusher plates may press large groups of microneedles inwards.
 *) Similar in principle to ECoG. May also be used to push threads of a 'neuralBits' interface after minimally invasive implantation of that.



--------------------------------------------------
Elaboration regarding otherwise already noted concepts.
Also, references with extensive commentary, facts, interpretation, etc.

*) Published study &#39;Neural Dust: An Ultrasonic, Low Power Solution for Chronic Brain-Machine Interfaces&#39; suggests scalability (of analog amplifier at least) to ~20um, largely based on required CMOS amplifier dimensions to achieve usable thermal noise and power consumption, as well as modulated load backscattered power.


*) Open Mesh Electronics, seemingly injectable as fabric, reportedly have achieved better long-term recording performance, contrasted with flexible threads.
 *) Obviously, mesh effectiveness in avoiding chronic mechanical damage, seems to require not being taunt, allowing the flexibility of the thin mesh to provide sliding elasticity.
  *) Obviously, the mesh may be relying on the intersection of four lines as anchors, while tissue may slide along the lines. This explains literal geometric translation of flexibility to elasticity in a non-taunt mesh.


*) MAJOR - 'Indeed, the brain micromotions-respiration, vascular pulsatility and head movements, induce displacements in the order of tens of  microns  around  the  silicon  or  metal  shank,  which  leads  to  an  enhanced  mechanical  stress  around  the  shank  [13].' - https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aa8b4f/pdf
 *) MAJOR - 'single  neuron  activity  with  great  tempo-ral resolution (0.2â€“7 kHz)  [4]'
 *) 'In rat brains, these micromotions are on the order of tens of microns for  respiration-induced  pressure  and  0.2  Î¼m  due  to  cardiac-induced pressure [13] (figure 1(A)). Finite element stimulation shows  that  tethering  forces  induce  elevated  strains,  located  principally at both tips of the probe [14] (figure 1(B)).'
 *) MAJOR - 'Therefore, the compliance is a function of structure, while flexibility (elastic modulus) is a function of material [20].'
  *) A remark predictive of the use of flexible mesh.
  *) Also, it is obvious that a 3D mesh would result in more friction, which could leave a 2D mesh as the absolute optimum.
 *) 'PDMS  is  widely  used  in  microfluidic  technologies, and has high viscoelasticity with a Youngâ€™s modu-lus that can be slighlty altered depending on the curing agent and temperature'
 *) 'Though  PDMS exists in medical class, that meets both USP class VI and ISO 10993, it has been reported that the curing agent might be toxic [76].'
 *) MAJOR - 'The main issue with polymeric implants is the long-term reaction to  a  water-based  environment  [8],  which  have  often  been  shown  to  fail  within  months  as  a  result  of  polymer  swelling  and layer delamination [20].'
 *) MAJOR - 'to  a  water-based  environment  [8],  which  have  often  been  shown  to  fail  within  months  as  a  result  of  polymer  swelling  and layer delamination [20]'
  *) Indeed expected, albeit with more flexible underlying materials than the proposed insulation.
 *) 'Collagenase has been proposed in the literature as  a  structure  breakdown  for  the  collagen  present  in  the  pia mater,  therefore  allowing  for  easier  implantation  with  mini-mum dimpling [96, 97].'
 *) 'Resorbable  polyethylene  glycol  (PEG)  as  a  temporary  glue  guarantees  a  more  reliable  adhesion  [111, 112, 114]  (figures  7(B) and (C)). PEG is a highly biocompatible, fast-degrading polymer,  that  dissolves  quickly  with  the  addition  of  water.  The shuttle can also take the form of a cylindrical needle or a hollow tip where the device to be implanted remains shielded inside [53, 115] (figure 7(A)) and vice versa: the needle can be placed inside a tube-shaped probe [116]. Surprisingly enough, many studies have relied on wide tungsten wires or rods with rather  large  cross-sections  [112, 114, 116, 117]. '
 *) MAJOR MAJOR - (D) 'Image of a dyed silk-coated fish-bone shaped polyimide probe with tip shown (Â© (2011) IEEE. Reprinted, with permission, from [125]).'
 *) 'Typically, the biore-sorbable coatings used are on the order of 80â€“180 Î¼m [62, 89, 151, 163], although thinner coatings have been reported [50].'
 *) '(DEX, BDNF and NGF) as well as a virally-mediated expression of Caveolin-1, and implanted in rat brains over 12 months'




*) MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR - Second sparse layer of electronics fabricated on top of the rest of the 'neuralBits', with high sample rate cross-correlation circuitry, to determine deep topographic maps by fine resolution (overlapping in time but not space) spike timing cross-correlation.
 *) A full >1MHz may be required.
  *) Direct electrode to backhaul (or even further back with active matrix to analog outputs) is entirely reasonable - one random length placed electrode site per thread would yield 129k analog electrode sites for such further analysis, more than enough to spatially oversample the expected ~5k-2.5k topographic maps. Multiplexing strictly analog outputs - reading just perhaps 128 electrodes at a time - would only require ~1k steps to 'scan' the entire connectome, is also entirely reasonable, and would allow MHz range 24bit ADCs, or even hetrodyne RF receivers, with just 8bits of high speed bandwidth being more than adequate anyway.
   *) Straight USRP connections are plausible at such scale - external connections and bit depth easily allow for this.

References missing Sources
 Somehow, the links or titles of some of the articles these apparent quotes originate from, seem to have been lost. Google or other search may be able to identify them, but the possibility of exact quotes now existing within multiple other, possibly less relevant, articles must not be discounted.

*) Action potentials are >>250Hz . Local Field Potentials are non-spike. High bandwidth (~10kHz) is in fact required, further complicating the technology.
 *) 'LFPs have a critical role in coordinating the activity of different regions of the brain, and synchronizing the activity of individual neurons with that of a neural network, through phase locking to the global rhythm10'.



*) MAJOR - Neural dust study 'Fig 8' shows very small amounts of backscattered power change (apparently <ppb) from 20um devices, which seem to be requiring wider transistors than 100um devices (implying the transistors are the length of the not-square device).
	*) MAJOR - This suggests much more than 20um side dimensions are actually needed, and that input transistor footprints (100um) are *much* larger than the 'thread' electrode spacing dimensions (~50um - ~75um) . This would explain the absence of addressing in-thread.

*) Neural dust study mentions that analog input FET may be calculated.

-

Neural dust study graphs should match -
Whatever Vneural is, multiply by 3, put this in as the acceptable v-n ('input-referred voltage noise') , apply correct numbers for '4 * k-B * T' , get 'minimum bias current' . Power consumption must be less than what is available on the device.

Ideally, FET size is as small as possible, before too much bias current is required.


I-DS == ( pi / 4 ) * ( ( 4 * k-B * T ) / v-n ^ 2 ) * ( ( k-B * T ) / q ) * BW
and I-DS == 'minimum bias current' (power consumption)
and v-n == 'input-referred voltage noise'
and 4 * k-B * T == 'drain-source voltage of the FET must be at least ~' ... 'or 100mV'

'As a result, the FET must be large enough to be able to sustain this minimum bias current.'

'As a result, neural dust must capture enough power from the interrogator to sustain both 100 mV and the minimum current required to ensure that the thermal noise does not dominate the AP voltage. This is defined as the power limit.'

'Therefore, for a BW = 10 kHz and voltage SNR at the input of the FET of 3 (which sets vn based on Vneural ), we can compute the minimum allowable size of the FET, restricted by the noise limit.'

*) Voluntary filter software. Threshold number of neurons may filter involuntary brain activity from willful actions. Such a filter may apply not only to motor output (presumably such a filter is already innate) but also for any &#39;object&#39; a user may &#39;imagine&#39; as a means of communicating or recording mental images.




*) MAJOR MAJOR - Stimulating larger areas than recording may be highly desirable in some locations (eg. &#39;perhipherial&#39; vision areas of relevant topographic maps), on account of the need to force individually strong precepts .





*) MAJOR - Thread elasticity should be considered. Spring like coiling, or regular bending, may offer both an insertion technique and better biocompatibility.

*) Electrical fields beyond the glial scarring must be sought out by transistor.
 *) Accomodating geometry. Side spines may both increase surface area and provide a location for at least some transistor parts.
 *) Persistent dispersants - break down any insulating properties of nearby non-neural tissue.
  *) Nanoparticles. 
  *) Encapsulated conductive carbon nanotubes (to become more &#39;sticky&#39; after some dispersion away from source).
 *) Neurons may be physically unable to tolerate mechanical motion.
  *) Retractable Coiling Space - May be used either to protect threads from external motion or to protect small projections from threads.
  *) Backward Thorn - May pull threads or subthreads outwards over time, using the mechanical energy of the otherwise problematic cardiac/respiration forces.





*) A single DAC may be multiplexed to a variety of purposes.

*) A DAC low-pass feedback filter will introduce an artifact when adjusted.
 *) Low-pass DAC increases the dynamic range by as many bits as its output minus one - due to shifting the amplifier input across half its input range with every step.



*) Successive approximation ADC should be considered due to the probable use of high-speed CMOS circuits.



*) Delta encoding should be considered due to the inherent band-pass characteristic and miminal analog low-pass requirement (lower than fast clock). Output digital bitstream must be converted to PCM (free-running) by IIR digital low pass filter. Raw bitstream allows other filtering without PCM mathematical operations.
 *) A prototype delta-sigma modulator should be built and simulated.

*) Voltage-to-Frequency converter should be considered due to the similarity to appropriate circuits for wireless/optical devices.
	*) MAJOR - FM &#39;capture effect&#39; could be *extremely useful* as transmission line interference would become irrelevant.
	*) High frequency counter power dissipation at the receiving end is a probable disadvantage.
	*) Bandpass filter bank may need to be analog ... this is potentially an expensive disadvantage.







*) MAJOR - &#39;KHFAC block is nearly instantaneous, as shown inFigure 2. A recent study[4]used a â€˜counted cyclesâ€™ methodto measure the time to achieve complete motor block and found that it could be as rapid as 7.5â€“14 ms;&#39; - https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/pdf/10.2217/bem-2017-0004
 *) MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR - Perhaps only the largest sensory/motor impulses need be suppressed momentarily and partially for safe neural VR to keep the &#39;IRL&#39; body reasonably relaxed.
 *) &#39;It is feasible to use KHFAC to block different sizes of axons, from motor[3]and sensory fibers[20], to the smallestunmyelinated axons[23].&#39;
 *) &#39;The two important parameters of KHFAC nerve block are frequency and amplitude. Nerve conduction blockrequires a frequency of 1 kHz or higher[13], and typically frequencies of 5 kHz or higher have been used. Therehave been no reports of a â€˜maximum plateauâ€™ frequency to achieve KHFAC block, with the highest reportedfrequency being 50 kHz[25].&#39;
 *) &#39;Both voltage-controlled KHFAC and current-controlled KHFAC waveforms have been used with no significantdifference in the reported response[27]. However, DC offsets can be a significant issue, especially in currentcontrolled waveforms, and care needs to be taken to utilize a circuit design that removes the DC offset[28].&#39;
 *) &#39;Computation modeling studies indicated that KHFAC resulted in an increased inward sodium current, leading to adynamic depolarization of many nodes under the electrode[33,35].&#39;
  *) MAJOR - At the very least, any more KHFAC nerve block than necessary, or in extreme cases of this effect, potentially dangerous permanent changes to axon may occur. At minimum, two separate electrode sites should be used, with downstream sensing of both, to allow automatic recalibration of minimum nerve block current.
 *) MAJOR - &#39;DC block of neural activity was first demonstrated by Pfl Ìˆuger[39]and has been reviewed previously[40].Untilrecently, however, the use of DC block was limited to physiological studies in acute animal preparations due to irreversibility of the block when utilized for more than a few minutes[41â€“43].&#39;
  *) In other words, highly dangerous.
 *) &#39;Petruskaet al.[43,47]demonstrated that by ramping the amplitude of the DC over a period of approximately 100 ms, it was possible toachieve block without inducing neural activation. This is in direct contrast to KHFAC which, as described earlier,always produces onset activity, even if the amplitude is ramped. The excitation at the cessation has likewise beeneliminated using a ramp at the end of DC block[43,47,48].&#39;
 *) &#39;Historically, DC block has only been utilized in acute physiological testing because the electrochemical reactionsat the electrode will eventually result in damage to both the nerve and electrode, and is thus unsuitable for long-termacute or chronic applications[42,49â€“51].&#39;
  *) If indeed not more than just the electrochemical reactions do not cause damage.
 *) &#39;Because of these issues, safeelectrical stimulation is achieved by limiting the charge delivery below established safety levels and deliveringstimulation with a charge-balancing phase so that the waveform has a zero net charge.&#39;
  *) Which would be guaranteed by audio transformer.
 *) &#39;The first method has been termed the separated interface nerve electrode (SINE)and involves separating the electrodeâ€“electrolyte reactions from the nerve itself. The second method utilizes highcharge capacity materials and maintains a charge balance over a period of many seconds to a minute or more. Thislatter method is referred to as CBPC. Both of these approaches have been demonstrated to significantly extendthe duration that DC block can be reversibly applied in the acute situation (from tens of seconds for DC alone tomany hours with CBPC) but neither method has yet been used chronically.&#39;
  *) MAJOR - DC block has not been used chronically (unsurprisingly).
 *) &#39;Current was delivered through the saline to the nerveto produce block. The results showed that long duration (up to 880 s) DC pulses could be delivered to the nerveat amplitudes sufficient to block conduction and still maintain complete reversibility of block once the current wasturned off[57].&#39;
  *) &#39;More recently the SINE electrode has been enhanced to use carbon black in the electrolyte to extendthe run time of the device. A 50 min block was achieved with complete nerve force recovery, as shown inFigure 5&#39;
 *) MAJOR - &#39;Platinum black, forexample, which is produced by electroplating platinum on platinum, has an effective surface area more than two orders of magnitude larger than bare platinum[60].&#39;
  *) Significant implications for any neural interface electrode.
 *) MAJOR MAJOR - &#39;If the force generated from both the proximal and distal electrodes was the same, then nerveintegrity was maintained. The ratio of PS to DS is used as metric for nerve damage.&#39;
  *) MAJOR MAJOR - Strictly allows an automatic safety protocol for chronic use.
 *) &#39;Figure 6shows the effect ofcumulative charge for bare platinum, platinum black and iridium oxide.&#39;
  *) Iridium Oxide, again used as electrode material.
 *) &#39;The onset response is produced primarily by the response of the nerve to thefirst few cycles of the KHFAC wave[4].&#39;
 *) &#39;demonstrated that the onset response can be reduced so that it lasts less than 1 or 2 sthrough optimization of electrode geometries and through the use of large KHFAC waveform amplitudes.&#39;
  *) Potentially unsafe amount of time.
 *) &#39;Without a direct test of nerve conduction block, it isdifficult, if not impossible to discern the effect. An example of this is the use of 10 kHz waveform for spinal cordstimulation[38]. Initially it was commonly thought that this waveform produced a conduction block of fibers[25,70],but subsequent studies have shown that this is unlikely to be the mechanism of action for this particular device[71,72].&#39;
 *) &#39;A better understanding of the mechanism of action should allow optimizationof the waveform parameters.&#39;
  *) Doubtful. Modern technology allows realtime multiple digital feedback algorithms with effective IIR filters and automatic safety limits, or in the most extreme case, at least iterative optimization (prototype only).














_Visual_
Due to the crucial productive uses of highly accurate visual precepts, and to a lesser extent the overwhelming priority given to visual inputs (ie. inertial cues) by humans, a more conventional &#39;VR headset&#39; may be appropriate in the short term.

Notably, very simple single-line Codecs (ie. DisplayPort DSC) are widely demonstrated not to have discernable artifacts, and screen &#39;burn in&#39; problems do not apply either, as the images are normally never static.

Existing headsets are probably adequate for most users, while well-informed full time users have the means to modify these existing headsets with custom 16k panels, custom aspheric lenses, auto-retightening/loosening straps, cooling/heating/humidity, and microfluidic foam cleaning. Fabrication of both those technologies are within the precision of commodity stepper motors as used by 3D printers and subsequent polish staging.

Hard > Frame > Packet+infinityBits > Backhaul > Codec > ActiveMatrix > LCD/OLED/LED > Lens > Wet-Retina

In practice, the lens may be skipped if an intraocular implant is used. That, however, would likely require fast refresh rate (ie. 1kHz) as well as equally fast and single-pixel precise EOG tracking. Refresh rate requirements are far higher than for foveated rendering, due to high sensitivity to apparent motion.

Normally, PWMdirect-/PWMalternate+ should track their midpoint around &#39;Amplifier Reference Ground&#39; voltage, to prevent small DAC outputs from improperly biasing ADC inputs. However, midpoint and &#39;Amplifier Reference Ground&#39; should never be a single wire due to severe noise. Consider that all DAC and ADC values may be regarded differentially in software.

PWMdirect/PWMalternate are intended for wide area stimulation/inhibition/block , in which case it is expected same signal may be directly applied to large areas, or DAC-LF output range may need to be adjusted across large areas (ie. safety limiting).

Reset lines are not externally accessible, being controlled perhaps by unique sequences in frame/packet, or at the start of frame/packet.

Some clocks may or may not be effectively identical (eg. Clock Low Power, Clock Config-ActiveMatrix, Clock Config-Codec), however, these pins must be separately available to be configured as such externally, rather than internally.

Ribbon PCB is expected as cabling, with WTB and/or mezzannine . Either should have thoroughly redundant mezzannine breakaway segment, with shear points of decreasing durability between some of those redundant connectors.


--Backhaul---

Foldable &#39;zig-zag&#39; flexible mesh PCB is expected. Threads split from bundles of perhaps 50 for a maximum total of perhaps 2000 connections . Physically, multiple logical &#39;bundles&#39; may be attached through a single ribbon cable, which is physically split to bundles, to threads, with the &#39;threads&#39; being a finer mesh anchored by breakaways to the &#39;backhaul&#39; mesh, which may have a foldable ribbon segment leading to hard chips.

Breakable strands may be used to keep mesh thread insertion points held taunt at desired places between backhaul mesh, allowing rapid, simple, dragging and pushing of the mesh fiber down at the intended location.


As an alternative to prefabricated mesh threads between backhaul mesh, bundles may be attached later by soldering. Severable &#39;tap&#39; points should be included along both backhaul and thread mesh as a provision for future repair work.

If solder, metal contacts at the end of a joining thread/bundle are to be push fit into wells of already hardened low-temperature solder (>45degC or >60degC preferred), which is to be melted under this force by fiber optics. Candidates for such solder may include elemental Potassium, Field&#39;s metal, Wood&#39;s metal (Cerrobend), Bi52, Newton&#39;s metal, Rose&#39;s metal, and dental amalgam .

In any case, two large traces to the outside of the thread/bundle/backhaul connections will provide strain relief, while zig-zagging of the smaller traces leading up to the joint may ensure adequate metal elasticity. Addressable digital lines, being fewer in number and responsible for far more electrodes, must be given exceedingly high priority in this regard.

Backhaul&#39;s ActiveMatrix is of course in addition to any Thread&#39;s ActiveMatrix (which could add perhaps another 25 electrodes perhaps to reach deeper sparse neurons) .


Rigid PCBs are not to be used anywhere in the design. Reinforcement or casing to be added only as strictly necessary.

Frames are transferred at very high bandwidth and may follow a defacto standard (eg. Ethernet, CSI/DSI, existing LVDS) or no standard (eg. USB3 FPGA GPIO) .

Multiple slow digital inputs may be fed to a buffer to be periodically read off at higher speed (ie. serializer/deserializer). External portions of this circuitry may reasonably be built with discrete parts. Internal portions may still be implemented with small discrete parts or dedicated chips, as these are at the hardware end of backhaul, not integrated closer to electrodes.


-Packet-

Address space must not be less than 24bit . Prefer 48bit .

Address space to address threads is probably infeasible if less than 10^5 (100k neurons) divided by not more than 12 (12x transmission lines) divided by not more than 16 (minimum expected electrodes per thread). Threads may be addressed by 10bits, 12bits, or 16bits. However, this is strongly discouraged.

As an extremely minimalistic example, a 12bit address space with 12x transmission lines, would support 49152 channels, with perhaps half of these allocated to 150^2 ActiveMatrix, resulting in ~20k dedicated electrodes and 10:1 contention for 200k electrodes, which may be inadequate for any MEA CNS BMI. The contended electrodes would theoretically provide only a ~35x35 ( sqrt(20000) / 4 ) sensorimotor &#39;image&#39; - which is may be drastically below native human perceptions - and only then if precise strong precepts could be exactly correlated/stimulated by each electrode (unlikely). Additionally, a 10:1 contention ratio is already very high. However, these estimates may rely on incomplete and less than robust estimates of adequate spatial resolution.


-Codec-

Studies suggest unsorted spike detection is adequate.

Codec should be RAM programmable to some degree (deactivation at minimum), possibly reprogrammed by thread addressable wire, possibly activated by unusually low clock speed.

Must support at least -

*) Two band IIR. High pass amplitude and low pass raw. May reduce high pass samples per second to 300 instead of 7000. May reduce low pass samples per second to 30 instead of 7000. May reduce bits to less than 12, perhaps 8 .

*) Spike count. Three &#39;tap&#39;/sample FIR cross-correlation match, accumulated per output cycle, in addition to low pass raw. May reduce spike count samples per second to 300. May reduce bits to 4 (2^4 == 16 ~= 7000/3/300 == 8) or 2 (2^2 == 4) .

*) Spike time. Only records first spike, counts number of samples. May interleave with other data. At 300 output samples per second, from 7000 input samples per second, 5 bits (32 times > 7000/300) would be adequate .

*) Spike list. At 300 output samples per second, from 7000 input samples per second, 5 bits (32 times > 7000/300) would be adequate . Aggregated across 30 electrode sites, assuming only two spikes across those sites in a 1/300Hz interval, bandwidth could be reduced approximately 15x, perhaps conservatively 10x , perhaps a total of ~230x compression.
 *) Much more substantial is the benefit at much higher sampling rates, assuming same rate of recorded spkiles. At a 100kHz bandwidth, a ~3000x compression ratio may be obtained, and may be crucially important for detecting miniscule and strongly low-pass filtered timing differences.
  *) Processing power is likely to be prohibitive. Many taps along an FIR cross correlation filter would likely be required to lower jitter sufficiently to allow even multiple neural events to be sufficiently correlated down to such small timing bins.
   *) A small number of such high-fidelity electrode sites may be sufficient for their deep topographic mapping purpose.
    *) MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR - Such sparse high-fidelity circuitry may be allowed far looser tolerance substrate/photolithography/overlay tolerances. Consider overlaying two separate &#39;nerual bits&#39; circuitry systems, all the way to dedicated electrode wires (which themselves may split across multiple &#39;threads&#39; in difference to the usual approach), with the higher resolution circuitry having been covered (excepting electrode sites) with a suitable insulating crude substrate.

MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR - FUNDAMENTAL - At least some electrodes must have FULL TEMPORAL AND PROCESSING-SENSITIVE SPATIAL RESOLUTION. Otherwise, there will be no way to distinguish which topographic map received less processed (more direct) information. It is possible, though perhaps unlikely, that FULL SPATIAL RESOLUTION may be required for this specific analysis (meaning spatial oversampling and spike sorting is not necessary for conventional studies of data presented to the neocortex or stimulation/recording mapping but may be required for passive observation of the underlying topographic maps not directly sampled).

Binary adder may be faster, counter/bitstream may be simpler. Both types of digital filtering should be designed.

MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR - FUNDAMENTAL - Full FIR cross-correlation in codec may be entirely feasible, with ADC at >20kHz, given that the relevant digital electronics tend to be relatively compact and high speed. Although IIR filters and such are quite efficient, Neuralink demo video appparently published by CNET Aug 28 suggests this is actually done on chip in 900ns to the point of spike &#39;shape&#39; detection.



-Bandwidth-

MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR - WARNING: - Spike time may increase these estimates significantly.

(1Ã—10^6Ã—4Ã—300)Ã—2 == 2.4Gbits (1M neurons bidirectional - spike compressed)

(1Ã—10^6Ã—8Ã—300)x2 == 4.8Gbits (1M neurons bidirectional - IIR compressed)

(1Ã—10^5Ã—8Ã—300)Ã—2 == 0.48Gbits (100k neurons bidirectional - compressed)

(1Ã—10^5Ã—12Ã—7000)Ã—2 == 16.8Gbits (100k neurons bidirectional)

(3840Ã—2160)Ã—32Ã—75Ã—2 == 39.8Gbits (2x4k VR Headset Raw Bandwidth)




-Amplifier-
Due to space constraints, it is likely imperative that only a single FET serve as the high-impedance low-noise input, even if a differential &#39;long tailed pair&#39; must be used. Also, instrumentation amplifers are NOT to be used, instead relying on the inherent shielding of the &#39;wet&#39; surroundings to prevent excessive sensitivity to &#39;outside&#39; electrical fields (ie. 50Hz/60Hz ELF) by the small microelectrodes.

Amplifier is implied at every ADC input. Amplifier noise floor of &#39; (3Hz - 10KHz)5.9Î¼VRMS &#39; (Neuralink AnalogPixel Specification) seems fairly typical and is only slightly higher than the thermal noise floor at &#39; 38degC,100kOhm &#39; input .

Reference (ie. ground) voltage bias should ensure amplifier *output* is at midpoint. If multiple ground reference electrodes are used at different voltages, possible interference and electrochemical current balance between them must be considered. &#39;Common source&#39; FET amplifiers with non-isolated power supplies may be a problem in this regard. Each thread must be able to access a reference voltage bias wire as this may be useful to generate exceptionally small gate offset voltages to accommodate CMOS tolerances between separate devices (ie. threads).

Amplifier bias voltage (ie. &#39;ground&#39;) must not be equal to either power supply rail (ie. not 0V) , to allow DAC stimulation to be repurposed for reversing any electrochemical charge imbalance caused by any possible bias current.

Whenever practical, amplifier shall include a low-resolution low-voltage DAC connected to a second gate (ie. a smaller gate on a dual-gate FET) or otherwise able to add low-frequency DC &#39;feedback&#39; to improve ADC dynamic range (particularly if electrochemical effects are excessive). May also be usable as a software controlled gate offset voltage to accommodate CMOS tolerances between separate devices (ie. threads).

Low pass filtering of bias currents introducing significant high-frequency noise may be a design risk. This must be evaluated by simulation models, experiment, and possibly precautions. As a precautionary measure, if a single dedicated &#39;ground&#39; electrode is required, this is at the top of threads, closest to the surface, where the highest resolution recordings are most likely necessary.

Amplifier bias current may present a risk of undesirable stimulation above 2pA. However, this is highly speculative, and even if numerically correct, ignores the possibility of some neural damage being tolerable.




-DAC-
Resolution must be much better than 100nA@10kOhm/50kHz equivalent pulse total charge (ie. a 12bit/300Hz ADC must have a maximum voltage of +/- 0.024576V (ie. << 1mV max ) ) (ie. a 1bit/300Hz ADC must have a maximum voltage of << 6uV) . However, this is highly speculative, and even if numerically correct, ignores the possible desirability of some neuron loss being tolerable to reach a wider area. Consequently, DAC-LF range should be adjustable, at least for early prototypes connected to simple microelectrode arrays for early testing.
3.3V/2^12bits/10000ohm*(50000Hz/300Hz) == 13uA@10kOhm/50kHz equivalent
(100Ã—10^âˆ’9)Ã—10000Ã—2^12/(50000/300) == 0.024576V
0.024576/2^12/10000Ã—(50000/300) == 0.0000001A == 100nA

Must be capable of bipolar DC output, using a split DC power supply (consider that inverters can usually split voltage), to allow reversal of electrochemical effects (ie. charge balancing). This is not taken from analog amplifier &#39;midpoint&#39; reference, as that must be low-noise and may be biased to ensure midpoint amplifier output, rather than actually being at midpoint.

Must be able to briefly divert suitably attenuated output to ADC (not amplifier) input during conversion cycle, so as to be repurposed as a successive approximation ADC. Unless DAC is delta-sigma, in which case this is not feasible and the ADC is also assumed to have similar capabilities. ADC alone being of delta sigma type does not excuse lack of the divert from DAC capability, as the footprint is expected miniscule, for at least the design benefit of being able to swap another type of ADC later.

DAC output resistance must be at least 10kOhm . Any lower impedance must be limited to a small number of electrodes, especially in any single region, for SAFETY.



-Electrode-
Electrochemical dissolution is a major concern. Coating thicknesses should be at least several micrometers. Durability should be tested thoroughly by connecting to potentially damaging amounts of current in a suitably conductive fluid, device lifespan should be calculated from this and expected bias/stimulation/stray currents.


-UltraIsoPSU-
If isolated power supplies are required for some reason (perhaps one per thread), regardless of other amplifier/addressing considerations, a piezoelectric transformer should be used. As part of backhaul, a many-layer piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer should provide a power source, with isolated power supplies implemented as ~100um diameter devices near thread inputs. Footprint for such a device is expected 10mm*10mm ( sqrt(10000) * 0.1mm ) . As such, the secondary receiver crystal could be embedded in the thread, or in a layer stacked on top of other circuitry, or included inside chip.

Frequency must be settable, both well outside, and well inside, the useful frequency for powering neural dust.


-FakeNeuron-
A fake neuron circuit will be available.

*) Spikes (2.5ms, 10uV, 15Hz)
*) Spikes (2.5ms, 10uV, 250Hz)
*) Spikes (0.125ms, 10uV, 4kHz)
*) Common Mode Noise (millivolts).

*) Local Field Potential (1mV, 5Hz, sawtooth wave)
*) Local Field Potential (1mV, 10Hz, square wave)

*) Common Mode Rails (1mV, <1Hz)

*) Bias current pass/fail check.



-Modeling-

*) All worst-case expected parasitic effects (ie. power wire resistance/inductance/capacitance) should be modeled in simulation by discrete components.

*) A physical prototype with few channels may be built by discrete components.







_NeuralDust_
Published study &#39;Neural Dust: An Ultrasonic, Low Power Solution for Chronic Brain-Machine Interfaces&#39; suggests scalability to ~20um, largely based on required CMOS amplifier dimensions to achieve usable thermal noise and power consumption, as well as modulated load backscattered power.

Addressing/Localizing large numbers of such devices would seem to require additional circuitry, and possibly additional bandwidth requirements.

An obvious advantage is the probable relative lack of chronic sensing issues, due to the free-floating mechanical characteristics.

Hard > Carrier-FM > Ultrasound > Resonator > Rectifier > Code > DAC-LF > Wet-Dust
	Hard > Carrier-FM > Ultrasound > Resonator > Rectifier > Power
Hard < FFT < ADC-RF < Ultrasound < Resonator < Load < ADC-LF < Wet-Dust
	Hard > Carrier-FM > Ultrasound > Resonator > Load < (Resonant Frequency or Amplitude Modulating)
	Hard < FFT < ADC-RF < Ultrasound < Load < (Resonant Frequency or Amplitude Modulating)


_Neuralink ASIC_
As described by &#39;An Integrated Brain-Machine Interface Platform With Thousands of Channels&#39; .

Notalble performance characteristics include scalability to at least 3072 channels total.

Apparently a notable disadvantage of this system as described may be the rather large footprint per pixel - perhaps approximately - (sqrt(23000Ã—18500)/sqrt(3072) == 372um ) * 2000um . Another notable disadvantage may be power dissipation of ~1W/4000channels , though this reported figure of 0.25uw/channel is five times the reported 5.2uW/AnalogPixel, and may be stimulation power of less thermal consequence.

Hard < Backhaul (ASIC) < ADC-LF (AnalogPixel/ASIC) < Wet-Needle


_ThreadMicroelectrode_
Addressable electrodes using binary counter circuitry similar to what is expected to be found with modern &#39;addressable LED pixels&#39;. In practice, amplifier circuitry is expected to occupy a larger CMOS footprint. Mesh construction should allow adequate surface area. Alternatively, amplifier footprints may force some devices to be located at electrodes, while others are sent as analog nearer or up to the backhaul point.

Hard > Backhaul > 12bits+infinityBits > Thread > Counter > DAC-LF > Wet-Needle
	Hard > Backhaul > 12bits+infinityBits > Thread > Counter > infinityBits > (addresses of more Counter)
Hard < Backhaul < 12bits+infinityBits < Thread < Counter < ADC-LF < Wet-Needle
	Hard < Backhaul < 12bits+infinityBits < Thread < Counter < infinityBits < (addresses of more Counter)


_ActiveMatrix_
Selectively applies amplifier/ADC/DAC to many more analog wires, in addition to the remaining electrodes having been converted digitally continiously (see: ThreadMicroelectrode). Intended to conserve limited total space for circuitry and minimize probe diameter. Particularly intended for research or early-adopter devices, for which the number and location of desired neurons may not be known.

Active matrix is essentially used as a simple and compact &#39;multiplexer&#39;. Active matrix and associated amplifier/ADC/DAC circuitry expected to be included in backhaul. Mesh construction may negate the concern over total space for circuitry and probe diameter.

Each ActiveMatrix connects one ADC/DAC to one of a specific set of electrodes - mapping of ADC/DAC to electrode is not arbitrary, and this effectively guarantees many electrodes in a single location will not be used.

Beware the ActiveMatrix itself requires addressing by something like a binary counter .

Hard > Backhaul > 12bits+infinityBits > Counter > DAC-LF > Bitmask > Counter > ActiveMatrix > Thread  > Thread > Counter > DAC-LF > Wet-Needle
	Hard > Backhaul > 12bits+infinityBits > Thread > Counter > infinityBits > (addresses of more Counter)

	Hard < Backhaul < 12bits+infinityBits < Thread < Counter < infinityBits < (addresses of more Counter)


_ThreadActiveMatrix_
Pushes the &#39;ActiveMatrix&#39; onto the thread itself, so that only some electrodes on the thread are available simultaneously. Likely an advantage if electrodes at some depths are found not useful.

In practice, it is probably best to use a combination of &#39;ThreadMicroelectrode&#39; , &#39;ActiveMatrix&#39; , and &#39;ThreadActiveMatrix&#39; .

Hard > Backhaul > 12bits+infinityBits > Thread > Counter > DAC-LF > Bitmask > Counter > ActiveMatrix > Wet-Needle
	Hard > Backhaul > 12bits+infinityBits > Thread > Counter > infinityBits > (addresses of more Counter)
Hard < Backhaul < 12bits+infinityBits < Thread < Counter < ADC-LF < Bitmask < Counter < ActiveMatrix < Wet-Needle
	Hard < Backhaul < 12bits+infinityBits < Thread < Counter < infinityBits < (addresses of more Counter)
	

_ECoG_
A far higher than usual resolution ECoG interface, or at least more convenient than EEG, in the hopes that clearer Local Field Potentials, or potential to stimulate/inhibit, will yield results which may supplement a more precise interface. Possible use cases include observing the spread of information from such a location as the occipital lobe, or improvement of sleep quality by automatic room climate control.

Hard > Backhaul > DAC-LF > Wet-Surface
Hard < Backhaul < ADC-LF < Wet-Surface


_HybridOptical_
Combines electrical or optical wavelength addressing of threads on backhaul with Optical Coherence Tomography scanning of points along a thread with voltage sensing dye or liquid crystal as the sensor. A single point is &#39;chopped&#39; between bright/dark/amgient return signals by vibrating the Optical Coherence Tomography reference. Thread/Mesh is all-fiber-optical, with VoltageSensitiveDye/LiquidCrystal/Photovoltaic being plated at beam-split endpoints of the fiber optics.

Speculative, of doubtful utility. Voltage Sensitive Dye or Liquid Crystal (used in place of an amplifier/ADC) may not be adequately sensitive when embedded in a device not in direct membrane contact, and may necessitate such other resources as an additional microfluidic channel. Optical fiber is expected to be difficult to weave into mechanically tolerable mesh. Nevertheless, such obstacles are likely technically possible to overcome at scale.

Extremely small optical fibers (sub-wavelength diameter) may be adequate for ~30-points. Backward pointing spines may be attached by beam splitter, so long as these are of exactly equal length. Differing lengths will prevent separation by optical coherence tomography. Output by Photovoltaic+Code requires that optical connection to electrode/amplifier/etc not be made unless a counter detects the correct pattern (or other similar signal) produced by Optical Coherence Tomography vibration.

Thinner and longer threads may be made possible by the inherent use of a single transmission line (ie. optical fiber).

Hard < Spectrometer (Fluorescence/Polarization Analysis) < Backhaul < Optical Coherence Tomography (address of point) < [VoltageSensitiveDye]/[LiquidCrystal] < Wet-Needle



_ReadOptical_
Fully fiber optic transmission. Read-only. Relies on optical receiver being able to distinguish many transmitters by perhaps multiple high-performance techinques.

Speculative, of doubtful utility. Amplifier CMOS footprint may only be mitigated by mesh construction. &#39;ThreadMicroelectrode&#39; has similar potential to stack large numbers of addressable electrodes on a single thread. Nevertheless, fully fiber optic transmission may have subtle advantages in power density, bandwidth, analog sensitivity, and transmission line diameter.

Amplifier input FET dimensions? Possible at backhaul?




Addressing of wireless systems which must retransmit continiously due to inability to store power? IS FDMA/CDMA the only option?


FDMA - Intermediate Frequency (IF) Filter
	Only one component of a superheterodyne radio requires bulky passive components - the IF filter.
	Lack of ICs with precise oscillators not requiring external crystal or relatively large embedded crystal suggests this is infeasible.

FDMA - Ring Oscillator / Phased Locked Loop
	Phase Comparator (ie. Mixer) may be near equally likely to lock onto frequency multiples... this may necessitate prohibitive analog (or fast ADC/IIR/FFT) passband filtering.
		&#39;FDMA requires high-performing filters in the radio hardware, in contrast to TDMA and CDMA.&#39; -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-division_multiple_access
	Noise will not be strongly rejected from other-channel frequencies also using frequency/phase modulation, resulting in some jitter without prohibitive analog (or fast ADC/IIR/FFT) passband filtering. This negates the otherwise perhaps high-resolution ADC from the frequency/voltage conversion.
	Inherent ADC/DAC of frequency/voltage conversion and binary digital counter conversion makes this otherwise attractive.
		Partiuclarly, the possibility of using the high-resolution DAC output as a real-time offset to the ADC would eliminate the need for local low-pass filtering.
