_heading2 'Conclusions'
_t 'Reasonable reading, writing, and communication of human memory (objects, associations, priorities), may be feasible even from non-invasive (ie. MEG, TMS) brain interfaces, especially with minimal retraining in a VR environment. Perfect enough (ie. no retraining) memory transfers may be feasible from non-chronic invasive (ie. crude MEA) brain interfaces. Memories may have a spatial resolution parameter, much as any other object data (eg. as with visual image object pixels).

Recording small areas of brain activitiy sequentially is sufficient. Non-invasive interface in particular may benefit from sequentially &#39;scanning&#39; an expensive high resolution sensor array with a small observed area across the neocortex. Optogenetic sensors may benefit similarly. Microelectrode arrays may minimize bandwidth, ADC, and amplifier circuitry by multiplexing ES when intended only for connectome and synaptic weight recording (not sensory precepts).

Small timing and voltage offsets within the membrane of a single neuron may exist. Such may account for computational performance of biological networks orders of magnitude greater than the total number of synapses at ~300Hz analog bandwidth. Visualization of differences in these offsets between events may be feasible to infer from other observed activity. Such analysis is mostly anticipated as a diagnostic tool not obviously useful or necessary for any memory or information transfer.

Side channels (ie. by &#39;cross-examination&#39; under &#39;polygraph&#39;) have already long been sufficient to drastically reduce search space (eg. &#39;password&#39; digits) for any kind of authentication - what a person knows, what a person knows they have, or what a person knows they are. Nothing about &#39;brain computer interface&#39; changes the already urgent need for better secure storage, memory backups, self-wiping of mobile memory, or possibly of trusted authentication authorities.

Poor spatial resolution could plausibly obscure any connections which are within, or do not substantially activate, a large enough group of neurons. Poor temporal resolutions could obscure any connections which cause near equal changes in activity at near equal times. At least some useful results (eg. &#39;human connectome project&#39;) seem to have been obtained through fMRI - which relies on indirect indications having possibly the worst resolution simultaneously spatially and temporally .

More &#39;observedNeurons&#39; than 10k &#39;logical neurons&#39; or 10M &#39;physical neurons&#39; spread across the entire neocortex are significant performance benchmarks for a brain-computer interface. Fewer might suffice within a smaller region of the neocortex for some limited use cases.

Some basis for object memory recognition from recorded neural activity exists in the form of rough but recognizable images observed from neural recordings from the visual systems of animal models (ie. cats).'
