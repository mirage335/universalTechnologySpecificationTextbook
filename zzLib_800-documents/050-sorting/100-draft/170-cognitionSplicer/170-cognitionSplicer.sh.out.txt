Connectome and synaptic weights &#39;RPT correlation&#39;, overlay, from observed neural activity.

&#39;Brain upload&#39; and &#39;hive mind&#39; made possible by observing some activity from a living neural network rather than &#39;scanning&#39; &#39;dead&#39; or dormant &#39;neural tissue&#39;.

__ Introduction __
Feasibility and usefulness are well founded conclusions.

Existing hardware and wetware may be entirely adequate. Minimally complex scaling of hardware designs to higher spatial resolution may be beneficial.

___ Presented ___

*) Software algorithm flow diagrams.
*) Computation times.
*) Sampling times.
*) Sampling/input bandwidths (eg. 10MHz, 500kHz, 50kHz, etc).
As may be plausible.

__ Conclusions __
Reasonable reading, writing, and communication of human memory (objects, associations, priorities), may be feasible even from non-invasive (ie. MEG, TMS) brain interfaces, especially with minimal retraining in a VR environment. Perfect enough (ie. no retraining) memory transfers may be feasible from non-chronic invasive (ie. crude MEA) brain interfaces. Memories may have a spatial resolution parameter, much as any other object data (eg. as with visual image object pixels).

Recording small areas of brain activitiy sequentially is sufficient. Non-invasive interface in particular may benefit from sequentially &#39;scanning&#39; an expensive high resolution sensor array with a small observed area across the neocortex. Optogenetic sensors may benefit similarly. Microelectrode arrays may minimize bandwidth, ADC, and amplifier circuitry by multiplexing ES when intended only for connectome and synaptic weight recording (not sensory precepts).

Small timing and voltage offsets within the membrane of a single neuron may exist. Such may account for computational performance of biological networks orders of magnitude greater than the total number of synapses at ~300Hz analog bandwidth. Visualization of differences in these offsets between events may be feasible to infer from other observed activity. Such analysis is mostly anticipated as a diagnostic tool not obviously useful or necessary for any memory or information transfer.

Side channels (ie. by &#39;cross-examination&#39; under &#39;polygraph&#39;) have already long been sufficient to drastically reduce search space (eg. &#39;password&#39; digits) for any kind of authentication - what a person knows, what a person knows they have, or what a person knows they are. Nothing about &#39;brain computer interface&#39; changes the already urgent need for better secure storage, memory backups, self-wiping of mobile memory, or possibly of trusted authentication authorities.

Poor spatial resolution could plausibly obscure any connections which are within, or do not substantially activate, a large enough group of neurons. Poor temporal resolutions could obscure any connections which cause near equal changes in activity at near equal times. At least some useful results (eg. &#39;human connectome project&#39;) seem to have been obtained through fMRI - which relies on indirect indications having possibly the worst resolution simultaneously spatially and temporally .

More &#39;observedNeurons&#39; than 10k &#39;logical neurons&#39; or 10M &#39;physical neurons&#39; spread across the entire neocortex are significant performance benchmarks for a brain-computer interface. Fewer might suffice within a smaller region of the neocortex for some limited use cases.

Some basis for object memory recognition from recorded neural activity exists in the form of rough but recognizable images observed from neural recordings from the visual systems of animal models (ie. cats).

__ Spatial Resolution __
Capturing a person&#39;s sense of objects, associations, priorities, may require at least sufficient resolution for these objects to remain recognizable. Whether a neural interface has sufficient spatial resolution (observing sufficiently many and sufficiently small groups of neurons) may be crudely estimated by whether a hypothetical &#39;picture&#39; of a 2D *texture* in &#39;pixels&#39; or a &#39;model&#39; in &#39;voxels&#39; after proportional losses would remain recognizable.

Objects (eg. recognizable visual objects from visual memory in the visual cortex) represented within the correlated connectome and synaptic weights may have a *spatial resolution* in total perceptive fields as much as equal to &#39;desiredNeurons&#39;.

__ Recording Time __

Duration of observed neural activity before each neuron will have repeatedly reacted (or not) to every other neuron at least indirectly, which may approximately be sufficient to correlate connectome and synaptic weights. Strong inhibition, irregular synaptic weight geometric distribution, and long axons may additionally impose a minimum recordingTime of a few seconds or a few months. Applicable to fMRI, EEG, ECOG, MEG, and MEA.

__ Computation Time __
Correlation of neural activity to connectome and synaptic weights follows a summation algorithm followed by a normative statistic. TX events are converted to correlated RPT events. A similar algorithm is expected to correlate this smaller number of RPT events to other RPT events, establishing the order in which neurons are activated.

Inference of indirect neurons may require algorithmic iterative modeling of small artificial neural networks where activity is not completely accounted for by activity of other observedNeurons. Such modeling may benefit from structural assumptions (ie. a strong 90deg orthogonality between horizontal axons across 2D layers and vertical axons between 2D layers).

Other optimizations may be possible. An &#39;LI&#39; list may be divided into smaller &#39;LU&#39; lump of <<14bit numeric integers. Most RPT correlations will be short axons to only geometrically nearby neurons. Found RPT correlations can be ignored as soon as confidently identified once. Strong inhibition may be countered by using data taken at regular intervals rather than a longer continious recording.
