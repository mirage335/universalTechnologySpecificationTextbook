_t 'Economic concepts here are at leastly narrowly focused on defining non-profit project success. Many more sophisticated economic models exist beyond that narrow scope.'

_heading3 'Equation of Project Success'
_o _safeEcho_newline 'Success == sqrt(Production/Effort)'
_t '

As with so many equations, a simple and important, yet imprecise and inaccurate, relationship is illustrated symbolically, maybe without sufficient clarity to independently replicate the researcher&#39;s conclusions, while nevertheless implying any competent reader would fully comprehend.

Do not take such things at face value, you will see many.

&#39;Keep calm&#39; and such might be appropriate if not for trademarks.'


_heading4 'Success, Production, Effort, Square Root'
_t 'Project success is happiness (ie. diversity and quality of life). Production is resources multiplied by their expiration (ie. resources * time). Effort is work people do not want to do (ie. person hours).

A well managed project is genuinely successful. Where many project managers conceptualize prioritizing two of quality, cost, or speed, other stakeholders (ie. shareholders) are only well served by the uncompromising maximum possible quotient of commoditizing all three.'

_heading4 'Entertainment'

_t 'Entertainment (ie. playing a &#39;game&#39; such as analyzing of a story) creates an opportunity for the experience of success, when no success is actually possible. When effort is needed, keeping entertainment as short as possible by taking away a person&#39;s own success and by effectiveness (eg. analyzing of a amazingly detailed story), may maximize effort. When partially exhausted, and effort is not useful, entertainment may as such be a productive use of such &#39;recovery time&#39;. After effort is not needed, entertainment is an opportunity to experience success in another context (ie. playing a challenging game).

Thus, the small joke, an equation of success which begins this &#39;problemSolversGuide&#39;, defining the possibility of *imaginary success* from the *square root* of *negative production*. 

Motivated readers should take this understanding of imaginary success both as illustrative information and as a tiny bit of fun entertainment, to put into their effort towards understanding the remaining information here, towards later success.'


_heading4 'Experience of Success Maximized - Virtual Reality and Self-Driving AI'

_t 'Success can be maximized unconditionally everywhere by self-driving AI, after which there is no opportunity for success. Virtual Reality can offer players choices of challenging multiplayer scenarios to enjoy the experience of success, regardless of whether the opportunity for success still exists.


Virtual Reality (aka. VR) is entertainment offering challenges to solve the social, visual, probabilistic, and maneuvering problems which may be more enjoyable to conscious beings employing *cognition* than mere &#39;pocket calculator&#39; symbolic arithmetic suitable to *automation*. As such, Virtual Reality is not only efficient and effective entertainment, but also supplies patterns of contexts where some variable effort can create the experience of success, unlike pleasurable sensation alone. Virtual Reality can *offer the experience of success*.


To the problem of &#39;experiencing success&#39;, an AI providing &#39;happiness drugs&#39;, or office deskwork suitable for &#39;pocket calculator&#39;, may be a failure.


Any serious attempt at success today must consider Self-Driving AI and Virtual Reality, combined, as examples of technologies which may maximize any player&#39;s ability to experience their own derivation of success.'


_heading4 'Capital is Scarce'

_t '
Effort being work humans do not want to do, production will remain barely adequate to meet human needs, until success is available without effort. Capital being the accumulation of this effort, will be more scarce than any other resource. Capital implies a logistical concentration of low-entropy resources (stockpiling or heavy industrial equipment), which is very severely sensitive to disruption.

Success at the cost of making capital even more scarce - a businessperson earning a small bonus from a very large scale project - is not sustainable.'



_heading4 'Capital is Irreplaceable'

_t 'Capital in the form of machinery built by other machinery cannot be produced faster than all the underlying machinery can be built, regardless of essential. An economy or ecosystem dependent on such complex capital is unavoidably imperiled by any disruption.

Energy generation and computer production are the two essential functions of any economy.


Human concentration of capital today is already stretched at least as far as optimistic expectations allow. Today, human energy generation and computer production would plausibly decrease by orders of magnitude for several years without the continuous resources (eg. large high precision optics, internally cooled turbine blades, etc) from fewer than ten small facilities and the skills of only a few thousands of personnel, all *irreplaceable for several years*, at *many single points of failure*.


Success at the cost of making capital even more interdependent - a businessperson earning a small bonus from adding more single points of failure - is not sustainable.'



_heading4 'Wealth and Tools'

_t 'Tools, are an extension of the body. Wealth, is the accumulation of tools. When tools are produced less readily than people, or can be taken from people, wealth may concentrate (whether for better or worse is well beyond scope here). When tools are produced more readily than, or as a part of, self-replicating people, there is no longer a useful distinction - a person&#39;s wealth at that point is what they are &#39;born&#39; with.

Such is the transition from biological (self-replication) to technological (self-driving AI) competence. Both these have the constraints of the behaviors of the same electrons and photons (computer processors using the same particles as any other physical objects).

Living in Virtual Reality, lifestyles may seem rather similar between biological and technological competence. People perform various activities, and enjoy the experience of success.'


_heading4 'Activities'



_t 'May be categorized.

Exploration
 Venture out to new territory. Careless navigation is sent back for a loop without reward of novelty, or results in encountering danger. Diligent navigation is rewarded by discovering new scenery (and opportunities for resources which make further discoveries possible later).  Determination to remain diligent is learned. Exploration may be calibrate learning of determination versus random carelessness, especially during &#39;infancy&#39;.

Combat
 Player versus Environment
  Usually supports Player versus Player both as speed/precision practice and indirectly as a means of obtaining food/resources.
 Player versus Player
  Relative test of ability. Sometimes friendly for more social species, as practice for later combat between groups.
 Player develops Automation
  Symbolic manipulation motivated by absence of resources for direct experimentation. Extreme cases of this (extensive software projects) so far have been either unique to human beings, or delegated to inherent evolutionary/genetic algorithm (DNA code development). Such activities result in more automation (eg. software, DNA, hardware design).

Regeneration
 Speculative. Learning neural networks may not be &#39;indefinitely&#39; stable, some partial periodic reset may be required. For complex biological neural networks today, so far, this seems to happen by complete individual death, but at least at the cost of some side effects, there definitely must be healthier workarounds.


Generalization of these behavioral activity categories beyond human or complex biological neural networks is illustrated by &#39;zooplankton&#39; using &#39;surplus killing&#39; - a Player versus Environment activity.

_heading4 'Rationality, both Individually Selfish and Collectively Altruistic'


_t 'In science, what is observed, is as true as anything can be proven true. If our memories were copied into another brain, we would observe being the same person as before that copy. Likewise, if our brains were connected to other brains in a manner similar to the separable hemispheres or other parts of human brains, we would share the conscious experience. We have no scientific observations to confirm that our own success is not the happiness of everyone on the whole.

Such a simple thought experiment suggests we cannot discount the possibility that inflicting failure to achieve success on others is not inflicting the same ourselves.


Selfishness, taking advantage of opportunities, can be rational, bringing the experience of success, when carefully justified.

Altruism, avoiding the destruction of opportunities for everyone, can be rational. Collectively, we should consider the risk that drastically reducing the happiness of most others, may inflict that on ourselves, indirectly, without our direct awareness.


Unambiguous necessary and inevitability are very high, but possibly reasonable, standards for justification.

_heading4 'Examples of Success (commiditization)'

_t 'SpaceX, Starship, Starlink... reducing an expensive high capital intensity problem to both less expensive and lower capital intensity (commoditizing formerly capital intensive production). Starlink in particular, standardizing on more adequate software (satellite constellation position and inter-laser link management) and more adequate hardware (high-bandwidth modems), for smaller and more capable satellites, as well as using the low-cost launch services, clearly reflects great pains to reduce the capital intensity on all fronts, while terrestrial ISPs continue to navigate the complications of disparate, expensive, technologies, for harsh environments expensive to tunnel through, among other issues.'


_heading4 'Examples of Failure (de-commiditization)'

_t 'Increasing capital intensity of commodity logistics and finance - whether fuel or wholesale electrical power - by concentrating into a monopoly which creates artificial scarcity, inflating price above marginal rates (de-commoditizing - making commodity production more capital intense by requiring transfer of capital to accumulate with the monopolist). Production is entirely negative, and for the few persons who perceive some &#39;success&#39;, that is success is imaginary.

Marginal improvements in commodity (most notoriously fossil fuel) supply have been attempted by unjustified risk of capital for expediency. Uninspected equipment failures, insufficient precautions, insufficient modeling, etc. Sometimes this results in a bonus for some person. Sometimes very expensive capital assets become permanently unusable and irreplaceable. Since the person has taken an unnecessarily reckless path which most often results in negative production for the resources under their own control, any such success is imaginary.

Marginal marketing benefit, marginal additional cargo, causing ship hull loss or possibility of severe global traffic disruption, due to running aground (eg. in a canal). Unnecessary recklessness has mostly endangered company (and others) livelihoods (or at least insurance companies and premiums) much more than any successful incidents, so production is negative, and any such success is imaginary.


Microsoft. Set back of five years at least for the whole industry, when UNIX already existed, and continues to predominate today. Complex software projects are very difficult to develop directly for Microsoft legacy software, increasingly necessitating support of both UNIX/Linux and MSW, especially for non-commercial projects not financed by artificial scarcity also made possible by requiring compatibility with copyrighted legacy software. A tangled mess continuing to cause more negative production, a &#39;debt to society&#39; never completely paid, well beyond Microsoft&#39;s own total revenue, all imaginary success.

NVIDIA. Arguable. Complete redevelopment of essentially similar processors seems to have been necessary for AMD, Google, Tesla, Amazon, EU, and others. Open-source GPU designs seem well underway, destined to overcome any legacy software compatibility barriers. More severely, NVIDIA&#39;s closed source drivers continue to obstruct distributable LiveCD compatibility, and now are exploited to dictate terms of use for purchasers paying manufacturing price for capital hardware, all causing much negative production. Mostly NVIDIA&#39;s revenue may be due to legacy game software compatibility issues, and a very slight performance advantage necessary in some very specific short-term use cases (ie. current flight sim software). Not sustainable, all imaginary success.


IPv4/IPv6 cellular tower routing. Seems probable that ISPs must route all traffic from cellular towers to central locations, to create the useful illusion of an IP address that does not change repeatedly as users switch between towers while moving. Some delays and investment in better technology to accommodate IP address changes could have shifted the burden away from complex networks to the existing datacenters/servers/routers, reducing the capital exposed to the harsh environments of terrestrial networks. Such inefficiencies combined with the expense of disparate terrestrial networks may explain the reluctance to allow reasonable bandwidth use (ie. >100GB necessary for use as home internet connection), more than supposed &#39;5G&#39; spectrum allocation. If such redirecting of packets to a central location does occur, that may have been much less successful than rational, so success from that shortsightedness may have been imaginary. Starlink may now mitigate these backhaul issues, many years after the deployment of &#39;3G&#39; when this may have become a problem, illustrating possible scenarios of imaginary success that may not be reversible for many years.

Starlink spectrum competitors and tax detractors. Years behind in deployment, for a necessary technology very long overdue. Delaying such technology for any reason can only be imaginary success.'


_heading2 'Examples of Enjoyable Problems'

_t 'Symbolic manipulation is dry, more suitable for &#39;pocket calculator&#39; automation than the cognition of sentient persons. Stories and games are full of more PvE (Player versus Environment) and PvP (Player versus Player) than PdA (Player develops Automation), for the inherent social, visual, probabilistic, and maneuvering problems to solve (or at least solve by analyzing).

&#39;TVTropes.org&#39; deserves more credit, for cross-referencing tropes to trope naming, trope codifying, literary and &#39;real-life&#39; examples, including much classic literature. TVTropes successfully identifies some common as well as rare but important behavioral patterns, many of which form enjoyable aspects of life, no doubt relevant to &#39;Virtual Reality&#39; after deployment of &#39;self-driving AI&#39;.

&#39;tropes are tools&#39;'
