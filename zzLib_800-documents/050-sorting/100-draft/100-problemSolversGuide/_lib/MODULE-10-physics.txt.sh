_t 'Modern particle physics is an extraordinarily high confidence statistical testament, putting below insignificant probability, any possibilities of anything less ordinary than photon/electron computers and energy generators, drawing down on a finite supply of mass and energy, most of which is by definition uselessly noninteracting (ie. &#39;dark&#39;). Telescopes have confirmed such physics for astronomically large and distant objects, while particle accelerators and cosmic ray detectors have confirmed such physics for the smallest and most energetic particles far beyond anything commonly available or useful. Most recently, confirming the Higgs boson has very firmly established a &#39;standard model&#39; of few elementary particles, their uselessness, and the uselessness of anything those could possibly be composed of. For the most part, physics seems basically solved, to the point that carbon fiber and carbon nanotube composites are close to any possible end point of materials science. Seemingly, modern physics research effort is continuing beyond the point of diminishing returns now, albeit much effort was expended to the discovery and confirmation of such simplicity. At the very least, there is more opportunity for real success of all kinds from physics lab software for Virtual Reality, and the semiconductor industry behind that, than from finer estimation of the Higgs boson mass.

Warp drive, alternate dimensions, time travel, perpetual motion, unlimited space, unlimited time, instant computers, rapid travel to unexplored stars, more than marginally more useful superheavy stable elements, or subatomic machines, are all now very unlikely. Technology of the future will continue to work much like the biology of the past, in some cases necessarily so even within efficient Virtual Reality simulation. From doubling times to manufacturing rates, some slight improvements here and there. Suggestions otherwise are &#39;handwavium&#39; (not possible by exceptionally strong scientific consensus on physical &#39;laws&#39; applicable to anything in universe) and/or &#39;unobtainum&#39; (requiring materials substantially beyond well established scientific consensus on limits of possible particles). Only successful communication with a neutron star or magnetar surface, or availablility of tons of antimatter from black hole sources, will substantaially change even the commonly available materials or computation rates, and then only long after humans less enjoyable labors have already been obviated by self-driving AI.

From the smallest quantum limits on computers to the most distant edges of energy from the observable universe, from beginning in chaos, to ending in chaos: you&#39;re stuck so have fun while you even get that choice. At ~10^26W/star, ~10^36W/galaxy, ~10^40-~10^60W/reachableGalaxies, and maybe ~10W/cognition, maybe ~10W/VirtualReality, *you really should be able to find some things to do and some people you can work with, without wasting so much of other people&#39;s exasperation*.


So maybe just *skim this part briefly* just to feel around the simple walls of your confinement, anchored to which your projects may build something a little more interesting within.'

_t 'Solids, liquids, gasses, and plasmas, can be subdivided into cells, or finite elements. Failure of solids can be predicted by finding excessive stress at a given point of an object under external loads (including gravity).

Transmission of pressure and motion through fluids can be determined by arithmetic operations on volumes divided into finite elements.

Modeling failure of solids, or flow of liquids/gasses/plasmas, may require division into discrete time integrals. The combination of many finite elements and short time intervals may be computationally expensive, so accurate simulation of real-time events may be difficult (requiring much software optimization, approximation, and fast computers), but not impossible.

Compressibility, and the influence of past states, can complicate the behavior of materials, especially fluids. Accurately characterizing the disassembly of solids, transition between phases of matter, and flow of liquids/gasses/plasma, remains an area of intense computational study (or software improvement). Even for common materials under room temperature conditions, such as water, achieving sufficiently accurate measurements of simple physical properties, is still an area of intense scientific research.

The combined difficulty inherent to accurately modeling systems consisting of many materials, which may not be well measured, as the sum of many tiny parts, changing rapidly from one time interval to the next, is a key justification for the continued use of physical models, specifically wind tunnels and wave tanks.

Although the forces involved are always subject to simple arithmetic, complex interactions can become difficult to model. Failure of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge included interactions between at least turbulent air flow, elastic materials, and resonant mechanical circuits. Whether the ultimate cause of failure could be more accurately characterized as a match between wind gusts and a resonant filter, or areoelastic flutter, remains debatable.

Lottery machines exploit these complex interactions to generate a random stream of numbers, of cryptographically strong unpredictability.'



_heading3 'Classical Mechanics'

_t 'Newton&#39;s three laws of motion, qualified by a more modern understanding of relativity.

1) In an inertial reference frame, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a force.
2) In an inertial reference frame, the vector sum of the forces &#39;F&#39; on an object is equal to the mass &#39;m&#39; of that object multiplied by the acceleration a of the object: &#39;F = m * a&#39; .
3) When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.

For example, Earth&#39;s gravity being a force of 10m/s^2 acceleration multiplied by interacting on the mass of an entire object, a 10kg mass on Earth, will experience a 10kgF force, and through (virtual) photon interactions, impart that 10kgF force onto the surface of the Earth it is steadily in physical contact with.'

_t 'Solid materials can be classified by their compressive, tensile, and shear strength, rated in tolerance for a given force across a given area.

Solid objects under pressure deform. Quantity of deformation per unit of pressure is determined by the material&#39;s elastic modulus.

Compressive, tensile, and shear, strength, and elasticity, are straightforward to measure with low cost equipment, and these measurements are entirely sufficient to simulate structures (tower maximum wind load, aircraft maximum load, submarine hull maximum depth, shelving maximum load, etc).


Excessive pressure results in permanent deformation, often considered permanent damage. Pressures below the material yield strength, will result in no permanent change. This property allows precision objects, like optical flats, to safely retain their shape to subatomic tolerances during handling.

Pressures significantly beyond yield strength, measured as ultimate tensile strength, result in breakage (separation).

Geometry of solid objects may be arranged to take advantage of these properties, or multiple materials may be combined in a composite structure, but the relationships remain unchanged. A thicker steel cable may sustain greater total load, but only because the pressure to separate is spread over a wider cross-section.

Material properties are scientific studied by destructive testing using a simple machine. Typical failure points may be used by engineers to estimate necessary materials for safe operation of structures (eg. bridges) under loads.'

_t 'Space and time are equivalent, as are mass and energy.

An object at rest is traveling completely through time. An object moving at the speed of light is moving completely through space. Objects, energy fields, or other entities cannot move faster than light, as they would actually be moving backwards in time.

Energy has mass. Energy, in joules, equals mass in kilograms, times meters per second squared, or E=mc^2. An object in motion or within an energy (ie. gravitational) field that would cause motion, has more mass than an object strictly at rest. Matter itself is essentially a storage medium for energy, and can be converted to forms more commonly recognized as energy. Matter/antimatter and black hole interactions in particular result in the direct conversion of matter to energetic photons. Electron/Positron (mass) interactions can produce pairs of photons (energy), and vice-versa, with some probability, when a high-energy collision seemingly causes blending of details that would give these particles distinct identities. That is to say, particles may vaguely be thought of as slightly different arrangements of the same field fluctuations. 

All of these equivalencies are relative, and usually considered only within specific frames of reference, rather than the entire universe. If a photon traveling at the speed of light were to somehow emit another photon, an external observer would see two photons traveling at the same speed, while the photon itself would &#39;live out its life&#39; in the literal instant of time before the second photon could have appeared to move away, since photons travel only through space, never experiencing time. Similarly, a participant traveling at half the speed of light, launching another object at half the speed of light, would see the second object moving away at that speed, while an external observer would see the second object moving at somewhat less than twice the speed of the first. Likewise, mass and energy are measured relatively, as one spacecraft might be moving faster than the other.

Universal constants do exist, despite relativity. An electron would have 2000 times less mass than a proton in exactly the same place under exactly the same conditions, anywhere in the universe. Notably, photons of differing wavelengths, frequencies, energies, and mass, emitted by distant supernovae, have arrived on telescope imaging systems, exactly simultaneously.

While relativistic speeds or quantities of energy are not common in everyday life, practical applications do exist, as well as exceptional demonstrations of scale. Global electrical energy production at 16TWh is equivalent to 0.64 grams of mass. Significant quantities of mass actually transit over electrical power lines. Relativism also allows some particles to last longer than they otherwise would. Muon tomography, using cosmic rays to probe inaccessible locations, is a notable application (although not essential for machinery). Doppler effects, shifting the frequency/wavelength of photons, are a practical consequence of the inability to exceed the speed of light.

Accelerating significant quantities of mass to significant fractions of the speed of light is expensive, but not impossible. Well understood laws of physics do allow large energies, high velocities, to be imparted to small particles, or with the conversion of significant mass to energy, acceleration of entire spacecraft to significant fractions of lightspeed. Resources available at stellar scale allow efficient interstellar travel, resources (ie. tons of antimatter) available at galactic scale allow travel at >0.5c, and interstellar medium allows some possibility of magnetic/fusion &#39;braking&#39; for arrival.'

_heading2 'Quantum Physics'

_t 'Classical physics describe effects which predominate energy generation, and useful computer circuits.

Quantum physics explain some limitations of measurements and projections in everyday life, with the diameter of the near perfectly shaped lens of the eye accounting for angular resolution, and similar limits applying to manufacturing by photolithography. Quantum physics also has some effects constraining the design of small transistors.'

_heading3 'Quantum Mechanics'

_t 'All moving objects also vibrate. Vibration may be linear or circular, as light may be polarized. Mass and velocity determine the frequency. Frequency, across distance, determines wavelength, the geometric distance between one bounce and the next. Large masses (ie. Newton&#39;s entire falling apple) moving slowly have both low frequencies, and short wavelengths.

Photons exemplify quantum mechanical behavior. Small, and moving fast, their wavelengths are generally larger than their own apparent diameters. Detectable photons can be created under artificial conditions from below the range of human hearing, 10Hz, to 10^19Hz, orders of magnitude beyond trillions of times per second. Wavelengths for these photons range from planetary dimensions, to smaller than an atom. Even more energetic photons are commonly available from cosmic sources.

By contrast, a train car moving at reasonable speeds has immeasurably slow frequencies, across immeasurably short wavelengths. Classical mechanics remains an accurate model for predicting the behavior of large groups of objects that would be better described by quantum mechanics, such as atoms.'

_t 'Particles are seen to arise from excited states of physical fields.

For example, photons arise from the swapping of electrical and magnetic fields. Capacitor plates, appropriately distanced, in free space, repeatedly charged and discharged, by an alternating current, will lose some of the energy passing through them, as photons, commonly referred to as radio waves. Antennas thus work by generating oscillating electrical or magnetic fields, which give rise to photons. After leaving the near field around the antenna, proportional to wavelength, the electrical field will swap position with a corresponding magnetic field. After another wavelength, this swap will repeat. In reverse, an antenna can convert an incoming photon to an electrical current.'

_heading3 'Rest Mass'

_t 'Not all particles have rest mass, though all particles have mass when in motion (due to mass/energy equivalence).

Particles with rest mass, like atoms, do not move unless pushed by a force (an interaction transferring momentum), such as electrical charge. Particles without rest mass, may be thought of as one particular form of energy, immediately jumping away at the speed of light.

Energy mass equivalence allows massless particles, without rest mass, to cause impacts. Solar sails and metal plates developing a small positive charge when exposed to light are notable applications. Light radiation can cause pressure, pushing a spacecraft away from a light source, like the sun. Photons can knock electrons out of their orbits, generating electric current, without direct conversion by a suitably small antenna.

Massless particles, at least photons, do not collide with each other however, unless the underlying fields are saturated. Energies required to achieve this are extraordinarily far beyond current technology, including the capability to construct artificial black holes.

At least some particles, the bosons, gain rest mass by interacting with the recently discovered Higgs field. Many composite particles, such as protons, are massive, and do not jump away at the speed of light, because of their interaction with the Higgs field. Other particles, namely photons, do not, and immediately jump away at the speed of light. Discovery of the Higgs boson, an excitation of the Higgs field, has resolved fundamental questions regarding the accuracy of the modern physics Standard Model.'

_heading3 'Uncertainty Principle, Quantum Tunneling'

_t 'All interactions in the universe happen by transfer of momentum. Where these interactions happen is always somewhat probabilistic.

A photon passing through an aperture may change direction slightly, randomly with some probability, because all particles are also modelable as fluctuations in fields, which integrate interaction with neighboring particles at the speed of light. Thus quantum mechanics related to the &#39;uncertainty principle&#39;, limits the angular resolution of telescopes, cameras, etc, proportionally to the wavelength of light. Larger lenses or mirrors, or shorter wavelengths, linearly improve resolution, to the point that the human eye and common telescopes are limited as such.

An electron next to a thin barrier can occasionally, randomly with some probability, tunnel through that barrier, jumping to the other side. Also related to the &#39;uncertainty principle&#39; - neither the electron nor the barrier have a definite location - and the transfer of momentum may occasionally not prevent an otherwise impossible crossing of a barrier.


Such quantum effects do not noticeably affect machinery composed only of large objects (ie. distinct from machines dominated by classical physics). Mostly, these quantum effects impose design criteria on optics (directly interacting with small photons) and small transistors (directly interacting with small electrons).'

_heading3 'Particles, Forces, and Interactions'

_t 'Modern physics, the "standard model, which reduces all of reality to a dozen or so particles and four forces" - Lederman.

Practical applications of physics seek particles and forces with desirable interactions, then assemble solutions, using components such as bulk materials, transmitters, and receivers.

Fundamental particles (eg. photon, electron, quark, muon, neutrino, Higgs boson), fundamental force fields (eg. gravity, weak, electromagnetic, strong nuclear), the periodic table, the range of commonly available photon wavelengths, and phonons (ie. acoustic sound), may seem worth contemplating whenever it seems some new physics would be desirable if at all possible. High confidence in all research constraining these physics fundamentals does not suggest more such basic research will bring much success in any project.'

_heading3 'Photons'

_t 'Photons deserve special mention because of their uniquely valuable properties for communications and probing. Photons (whether far field &#39;real&#39; or near field &#39;virtual&#39;) through their electromagnetic fields are the predominant carrier for momentum between particles, and all interactions (&#39;all forces&#39;) in the universe are transfers of momentum. Phonons are notable as vibrations between groups of electrons, another means of commonly available interaction, commonly transferring acoustic sound, also still predominantly made possible by photons.


A wide range of wavelengths/frequencies/energies are easily generated by a variety of means, including black body radiation (random motion of charged electrons), amplification/duplication (masers/lasers), changing electrical/magnetic fields generated by alternating voltage/current (antennas), relativistic velocity changes of charged particles (synchrotron, bremsstrahlung), and energetic decay from other particles/fields (gamma ray emission).

As massless particles, photons jump away at maximum speed, ideal for quickly transferring information. Interactions with matter are common, allowing easy detection, as well as investigation of remote objects they encounter (ie. RADAR, LIDAR, low-coherence spatial tomography, X-Ray tomography, X-Ray crystallography). Photons emitted from other particles also have similar but unique applicaitons, as with the pairs of gamma ray photons obtained by positron-emission-tomography (PET).

By contrast, neutrinos, while typically moving at the speed of light, do not commonly interact with matter. This allows them to penetrate entire planets with a small wavelength and without inflicting damage. However, their lack of interaction limits their utility in tomography, and renders detection so challenging, even communications usage is prohibitively expensive.'
