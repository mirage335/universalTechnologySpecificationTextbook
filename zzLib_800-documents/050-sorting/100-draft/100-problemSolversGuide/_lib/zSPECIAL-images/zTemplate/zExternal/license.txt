DANGER: ONLY a license compatible with usage within AGPLv3 licensed projects (eg. CC BY-SA 4.0, public domain, etc) are acceptable. Both GNU FDL and CC BY-SA 3.0 must be avoided (ie. wikipedia articles). Whether AGPLv3 is actually used or not, the ability to license code as such may be important later.
