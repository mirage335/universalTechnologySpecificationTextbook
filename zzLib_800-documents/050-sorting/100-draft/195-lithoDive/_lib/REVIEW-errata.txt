REVIEW - May be duplicative from (another) part of (another) document.

Elaboration regarding otherwise already noted concepts.


*) FUNDAMENTAL - MAJOR MAJOR - Clearly shows optical overlay is used with a 193nm light source. Albeit the machine may be rather old (1993), the 193nm light source continued to represent state-of-the-art until EUV. Consequently, it is not plausible that the interferometers also shown were used have ever been expected to remain accurate beyond a single wafer exposure.
 *) MAJOR - ASML's logo is obviously the optical overlay technique.
 *) MAJOR - Interferometric 'positioning resolution down to 5nm' .
  *) Although two marks are shown, theoretically at least four should be required to calibrate mass and thermal expansion changes over time expected of the interferometrically monitored walls of the slab. Some interpolation and assumptions may be implied.
   *) Animation shows only one of the alignment marks is measured twice, implying one mark is indeed sufficient for magnification and second mark is for thermal expansion calibration.
 *) High angle image sensors are indeed used to make detailed confirmations of 'focus, alignment, leveling' .
 *) Interferometer seems to claim '3-axis', presumably X translation, Y translation, and Z rotation (twist).
 *) Leveling is implied to take place by a system similar to an AFM laser side-bounce technique, implying that while X/Y overlay must be done to alignment marks, Z-axis tolerances are tighter than can be maintained across the travel distance. Whether this compensation remains adequate at EUV or even multiple patterning seems dubious.
  *) Perhaps more likely the additional leveling is done merely to reduce out-of-focus exposure time.
 *) Air turbulence control is implied to be laminar airflow across wafer. Obviously, this does not apply at vacuum, and at ambient, necessitates only a constant stream of airflow through the tool.

*) MAJOR - Slab and tool cabling may require encapsulation (ie. tubing) or coating to prevent dust particles, due to frequent fast motions.

	'For example, assuming an exposure area of 1 cm2, a dose of 10−3 coulombs/cm2, and a beam current of 10−9 amperes, the resulting minimum write time would be 10^6 seconds (about 12 days).'
		AFM lithography, among other sources, would presumably be much slower than that.
