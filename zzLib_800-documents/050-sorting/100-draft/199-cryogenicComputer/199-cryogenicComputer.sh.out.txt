_ cryogenicComputer _
Compact liquid cooled gas-tight sealed metal box for CPU and GPU.

Entire computers have the sole purpose of converting power and data in to data out. Users usually need either the highest single-threaded performance (eg. VR &#39;flight sim&#39;), a point of diminishing returns for responsive cost effectiveness (eg. &#39;web browsing&#39;), or very low performance (eg. &#39;smartphones&#39;, &#39;standalone VR&#39;, &#39;thin client&#39; terminals, etc).

Long has the time passed for compacting essential high-performance single computer hardware into a roughly standard size portable metal brick.

__ Introduction __
Heatsinks will not need replacement if corrosion inhibiting fluid is replaced annually and carefully kept clean of contaminants. Soldering, not welding, is nonetheless preferred, to allow disassembly for replacement of heatsinks.



Commercially available scuba tank compressors are the most straightforward technology for LN2 generation. Experimentally, LN2 supplies seem widely available.



Only when the computer is off, LN2 reservoir full, and/or chilled coolent too cold, should cooling stop.


Bendable &#39;Type K&#39; copper ( embrittlement >-253degC ) pipe is preferred for coolant loop.



Reportedly, a turboexpander can reduce compressor motor load (for LN2 generation) by ~10% - this is NOT worthwhile and will NOT be done.



High-lead &#39;bar solder&#39; is apparently currently exempted from RoHS, and may be absolutely necessary if whole metal box is cooled to cryogenic temperature, due to outside of box possibly not being under dry nitrogen gas, and resultant tin pest.

Lead soldered external surfaces should be if possible thoroughly cleaned (in case of splatter) covered by high visibility colored tape, as hazardous, not to touch directly.

___ Performance Improvements at Lower Temperature ___
Per LN2 published experiments... ~0.5 / (~195 + ~20) = 0.25581395/degC.

*) 9% at -20degC (R-410A used by USA Window AC and Mini-Split AC units)
*) 25% at -90degC (Methanol Freezing Point)
*) 50% at -190degC (LN2 Boiling Point)
*) 55% at -220degC (Liquid Helium Boiling Point)

___ Incompatible Materials ___

*) Tin.
 *) -70degC (embrittlement)
 *) possibly >30degC, possibly >14degC, may become non-conductive (tin pest)
*) Steel - -73degC (embrittlement)
*) Buna-N Rubber - -143degC

___ Tin Pest Mitigation ___
If tin pest, or tin embrittlement, is a severe risk, that cannot be entirely mitigated, several techniques may be used to minimize its impact.

*) Resoldering (with lead) of the few components (ie. capacitors) found directly in the vicinity of the CPU/GPU core.
*) Simply accepting eventual failure of CPU/GPU solder joints, given a good chance of repair/salvage thereafter with appropriate solder paste stencil.
*) Accepting motherboard failure and reflowing CPU/GPU core solder joints periodically by deliberate use of high-temperature (~300degC) in coolant blocks to remelt degraded tin.
 *) Requires pure metal tubing (ie. Type K Copper Type) and above-soldering high temperature compliant components throughout entire coolant loop.
*) Trickle cooling of components to slowly change temperature independent of chassis cooling (chassis allowed to remain above temperature at which tin pest occurs rapidly).

Some research shows that allowing tin to return to room temperature (or perhaps higher) in the absence of oxygen/water, prevents the formation of ice crystals which accelerate tin pest upon return to low-temperatures, in effect, reversing tin pest. Under a dry nitrogen/helium atmosphere, periodically cycled to above room temperature, tin pest may not be a concern.

External cold surfaces will still need to use lead solder.

___ Suppliers ___
Dewar size may be ~30L. Cost of LN2 fill may be ~$3/L to ~$5/L . Roberts Oxygen (eg. Winchester, West Virginia) may be able to supply LN2. Airgas may be more difficult to work with.

Comparatively, the cost of producing LN2 on site, has been estimated at ~8.5kWh/L, or $0.765/L at $0.09/kWh .

___ Presented ___
*) Suitable computer enclosure and techniques to improve portability illustrated by sketches.

*) Cryogenic issues and compatible resources.

__ Conclusions __
Laptops may combine the metal box with a radiator heatsink underneath, a keyboard/mouse on top, and a clamshell or sliding display above that. Switching from internal radiator to external cold fluid can bring maximum performance at any time.


Chassis Temperature - never below -160degC (embrittlement) or cautiously below -13degC (tin pest). Due to this chassis temperature limitation, dry nitrogen may be used in place of helium. LN2 condensation is an electrical insulator, and can be further mitigated by strong internal blower fan heater.



Coolant Temperature - depends on coolant fluid.
 *) Water/50%_Methanol - -40degC (freezing point)
 *) Methanol - -96degC (freezing point)
 *) Liquid Nitrogen - -196degC (boiling point)
 *) Liquid Helium - -233degC (semiconductor limit) or -269degC (boiling point)



Efficient terrestrial refrigeration may rely on gravity, at least with oil-free compressors and/or appropriate safety valves, with LN2 reservoirs for short-term demanding operations or long-term storage. Efficient space refrigeration may rely on direct radiative cooling, not necessarily available on terrestrial locales. Cooling compatible with both terrestrial and space use may necessitate isentropic expansion cooling (ie. stirling cryocooler).



RoHS ban of leaded solder is of negligible benefit and substantial harm, to the point that additional leaded solder may be worth adding manually to a few specific components (ie. at capacitor leads) near CPU/GPU chips. RoHS exemption &#39;custom made for a specific client or a small number of clients involved in scientific research or prototype product development&#39; may de-facto necessitate inefficient and unreliable small business involvement.
